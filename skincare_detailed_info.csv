A year later I bought my second jar and to kick it up a notch I bought SkinCeuticals H.A. Intensifier to add to it. This was life-changing. My skin is super hydrated, soft and clearer. I have combination skin and just turned 40 so I really want to be aware of what I put on my skin and slow any sign of aging and just keep things clear. I will say the combination of these products is fantastic for me.

I have used lactic acid, glycolic acid, retin-a, licorice root extract, niacinamide, kojic acid, mulberry extract, alpha arbutin and even bearberry leaf ectract. The only thing that seems to be lightening it is azelaic acid. So, instead of stressing my skin out, I'm focusing on thickening my outer most layer of the skin, as there is a lot of research that found that people who suffer from melasma have a thin stratum corneum , which is the outer most layer of of the skin. So, I moisturize, moisturize and moisturize. Then I use the azelaic acid once a day too, sometimes every other day.

This stuff is powerful. With it being lactic acid, though, it is also more gentle and moisturizing than some of the other AHAs. I have combo skin and am prone to acne, but have more improved skin clarity and texture with this product compared to even BHAs like salicylic acid, which is meant for acne. I have also not had much peeling. Even with the exfoliation, my skin feels moisturized after I use it. Along with my retinol, my pores are less noticeable and am having fewer breakouts. I often use it morning and night, and even with makeup on in the morning, it doesn't peel. It is not technically a cosmeceutical, but with the low pH and high concentration they sell it at in the U.S. (the EU apparently recently made Sunday Riley increase the pH and lower the concentration, but we still get the original here), it is a powerful product. I tried quitting it for about 2 weeks to try a combo AHA/BHA, but ended up adding it back to my regimen because it is so effective.

I have combination skin: oily, dry spots, acne-prone, dark spots. And this product literally has given me the most clear skin I’ve ever had with just using the sample of this product. My blemishes have disappeared along with the dark spots from post-acne. I quit using proactiv and la roche posay bc it never made my skin clear, it just kept it from getting worse. I use Differen at night but I was using that before this product and my blemishes still weren’t disappearing, just not getting worse. I’ve tried literally every product targeting acne but nothing really works. But with this Sunday Riley Good Genes, my skin is clear and glowing. I never understood what people meant when they said their skin was glowing, but now I do. I don’t wear a lot of makeup to begin with but now I feel like I need even less bc I don’t have those dark spots and blemishes to clear up. I would 10/10 recommend this product to someone with a skin type like my own who hasn’t seen results from products like proactiv, differen, la roche posay.

To my surprise C E Ferulic was fantastic. First, I was shocked its a liquid/oil that didn't make me break out. That's been my biggest issues with oils in the past. Second, it actually seemed to take redness away from existing acne I had. Finally, it made some of my pores less noticeable. I honestly can't say it was EVERY pore, or that it shrunk pores (maybe made skin tighter, can't say for sure) but I was impressed it was visibly improving my skins overall appearance. With the critical ability to low budget try before you buy, I was ready to invest in the whole bottle baby. My only negatives are the cost and there is a faint funny smell when you first apply.

I’ve had some random, unsolicited compliments that I looked great recently - on days I had no makeup on at all besides some eyebrow pencil - so I’ll take that as a sign this product is enhancing my complexion. Application is a bit tricky - it absorbs super fast, so I found it works best to apply it a drop and an area at a time to avoid having to use way more than the suggested 4-5 drops. For example, I tilt my head back and hover the dropper above my skin to apply one drop directly to my forehead, replace dropper and rub that it, tilt my head back again and apply a drop to each cheek and stop to rub in, etc - hope that makes sense! I hate the price tag haha, but I’d say at this point, I will be making this a regular part of my skincare routine. Also the scent is barely noticeable and disappears quickly.

I was initially using it in the morning and evening - but later limited it to my morning routine. I apply it right after my double cleansing routine and before my moisturiser. It feels pretty light in consistency - runny and watery.. you might feel you want more but I would suggest restrict the quantity to a 4-5 drops. It absorbs immediately and it causes a little tingling for a while. It does not have any color or a smell that would make you cringe. This serum has arbutin which is great for treating pigmentation issues - there aren’t too many serums with this ingredient and the vitamin c in it makes it even more potent . My skin felt more alive and peachy in 2-3 days of use. It did dry my skin a little but that could also be caused by the retinol I was using. I would definitely repurchase it because I feel its prescription strength and very potent. The ingredients really feel pure - I am a big skincare junkie but this one impressed me .

So far, I haven't seen any dramatic changes that I can specifically pin point, but I do feel my skin smoother and it seriously looks brighter and more alive. In fact, for the first time in a long time, I actually like the way my skin looks without makeup. I still have some small lines around my lips/eyes and my freckles still show, but there is something positively different and I'm willing to stick it out. I currently use it before sunscreen/makeup and at night after cleansing/before night cream. I did put some on my cheeks but a little too close to my eyes the other day that caused some redness, but nothing too serious or painful. Just be careful about that and wear sunscreen everyday.

I purchased this cleanser based on success with an iS Clinical Moisturizing Complex. This cleanser had great reviews and even though I felt it was pricey, I gave it a go. Packaging is good, I don't think it will leak during travel. The scent is good, not too strong. I use it as a second cleanser so most of my makeup is already removed by the time I soap up. It lathers just enough - not too much. It isn't drying and leaves my skin feeling nice when done. The one awesome thing about the cleanser is that you only have to use a tiny but so for the price, it will probably go a long way and I bet I will get double the use out of the bottle. When all is said in done, it is a good cleanser but I can't see giving it 5 stars just yet. I don't see a major change in my skin, but does a cleanser really change anything?

I don't usually write reviews but after the change this has had in my skin, I had to share. I've suffered from moderate to severe hormonal adult acne for over a decade. I've used everything topical under the sun to try to get rid of it and nothing worked to get of my zits and cysts all over my lower jaw line and chin. While contemplating accutane, I tried this without expecting much at all. Just used it since I've heard great things and knew it probably wouldn't exasperate my acne. Well, after three weeks of consistent use at night time, I am shocked at how much this has cleared my skin! I purged the first two weeks but stuck with it because I wasn't sure if it was due to this cleanser or not since I am always breaking out. After the purge, my skin for the first time in years have not broken out since. And this is coming from someone that got new zits every single day for the past ten years. I used to have extremely oily skin and this cleanser tamed it as well. I'm just shocked that a cleanser can make this much of a difference when nothing else worked for me ever.

I seem to be in the minority but, this left my face feeling stripped, red, tight and dry with a slight burning sensation. Also it smells nothing like fresh strawberries. It has a nasty chemical, fake strawberry smell. The kind of smell that you can almost taste if you know what i mean. My skin leans to slightly dry but more normal.

I rely heavily on reviews when I am making a purchase and when I come across a product that I either love, hate or feel ""meh"" about I like to pay it forward and share my findings. I am quite fussy about what I expect out of a product and if it doesn\'t work for me I move on. Likewise, if I like it and it continues to work for me I will be loyal for life (or until they change something about the product) And so it is with this Glytone Mild Cream Cleanser that I have been using for YEARS. The last bottle I noticed they changed the pump and while I did read the reviews that many did not like the new pump, I tried it myself before deciding. Many reviewers also mentioned that the formula might have changed and while I cannot say I noticed that as much I do want to voice my opinion that the new pump IS in fact horrible! While it does dispense a good and perfect measurement of product to cleanse my face, it clogs up ALL the time! It is a nuisance to use! I am pretty resourceful as far as coming up with a solution that will fix the issue, but I am still at a loss as to how to \'fix\' this. I am hopeful that Glytone will read these reviews (will Dermstore share these? IDK) and that Glytone will re-evaluate their continued use of this pump. I am patient and would certainly understand them wanting to use up the gazillions of pumps they might currently have and if they promise to come up with a better pump in the very near future I would be happy to wait. If not, will find myself looking for another product and that would be a share because they would lose me as a loyal customer. In addition to being a loyal customer to the one product I decide I like, I am very brand loyal and not only will I change my cleanser, I might very well look for yet another skin care line to find what works better for me with regards to the other products in the Glytone line I am using- night cream, spot remover, exfoliating lotion, etc, body wash. I am a patient woman and I will reevaluate this product after this new bottle is close to empty. And that would be such a shame if I had to start all over with a new product line.

At first I applied my nightly serum, the Dermal Repair Cream to problem areas, then followed lightly with an all over moisturizer & my Avene Thermal Water spray. The next day there was an obvious difference in the visibility of fine lines. After day 1 I combined Dermal Repair with NeoStrata Cellular Restoration & the results were even more impressive. By the end of 2 weeks the lines were completely gone. I have not purchased the full size because of the price, but definitely will be soon because the results were unfortunately (of course) not permanent. I have avoided all fillers, injections, etc to this point & believe I can continue to do so with this product.

I tried that at first, and realized how much product was being wasted, because the bottle was already an inch or so empty after using it 2-3 times. So what I do now is spray the pump three times into my palm, forming a small puddle (it took about 7 pumps to saturate a round cotton pad) and then apply it directly onto my face, which has been more than enough for me to apply liberally. The second thing is the scent. REALLY strong, but it’s been bothering me a lot less after a few times. I find it pretty soothing now actually. The scent doesn’t linger for long anyway. And finally, my skin has never been more plump, hydrated and smooth in texture. It isn’t exactly a miracle worker when it comes to smoothing out textured skin, but it really does help with the appearance of it in a subtle way due to its ability to retain hydration.

Skin's texture is refined, hydrated, toned, and left with a youthful glow.Vitamin C boosts brightness, Hyaluronic Acid and Niacinamide renews and restores the surface of skin against moisture loss. Peptides reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.While retinoid (retinol) can smooth wrinkles and encourage rapid cell turnover to make skin look younger, it can also cause redness, stinging, peeling, and itching. Retinol is also sensitive to the sun, which means it's not great to apply during daylight hours. Our serum delivers similar results, but without these aggravating side effects - even for those with sensitive skin.

A friend told me she has been using Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash for quite some time and she finds the results to be excellent. So, I tried it and have used it daily ever since. The difference between Philosophy and other facial cleansers, is that this is an exfoliating wash. It cleans the skin and also sloughs off old skin cells. Most importantly, it is not too rough on my delicate aging skin. So...good-bye dry flaky skin!\n\nI apply this to my slightly damp face and massage for about 30 seconds...always massage upward. And make sure you rinse thoroughly. It doesn't matter if you use this wash, or another, or soap, always be careful to rinse all residue off before patting dry.\n\nI do use this once a day, usually before I go to bed...and then I moisturize.

And if you have a gentle make-up remover, I would use it before applying a dollop of Philosophy Microdelivery Exfoliating Wash.\n\nThis product was designed to effectively cleanse the skin while providing resurfacing benefits.

The new formula however, is VERY different. The three big things I noticed:\n\n1) A strong fragrance has been added. The fragrance isn't bad, just quite strong, and unfortunately, fragrances most often cause irritation to my skin. I suspect this is the cause of the stinging I now experience with it.\n2) It is now more of a bead-style exfoliator, rather than a grainy one. For me, these are dramatically less effective and also more abrasive, making it unpleasant to use. My skin does not feel smooth and clean after using it, as it always had with the old formula. Instead I can still feel build-up in my pores.\n3) The wash is now more gel-like. The former formula was more liquid-y, with the small exfoliating grains mixed in well. Now, there are relatively few beads, suspended in a gel-consistency wash.\n\nI will not buy the new formula again.

My teenage daughter said I looked less tired and it was on a day when I was completely exhausted. Using the sample of this cleanser two days in a row was the only thing I had done differently. The only ""negative"" is the smell. It reminds me of a dental office. It\'s not a bad smell, but I\'m terrified of the dentist so this does not calm me or relax me in any way so I just get it rinsed off as quickly as possible and then admire my fresh, brighter looking complexion. (The smell does not linger, thankfully!) The price is reasonable and there is no denying this product really gets in there to remove dead surface cells.

Acne cleansers are too harsh, and sensitive skin cleansers are too gentle and moisturizing and often cause even more clogged pores. Enter this wonderful cleanser! I use Hydraboost Jelly Cleanse as my first cleanser, and its gentle properties set the stage for my skin to tolerate a second cleanser with the more powerful Power Cleanse. This combination has helped my skin looked brighter, clearer and more hydrated than it has in years. At 45-years-old, I’ve finally found my go-to cleansers, and I couldn’t be more pleased. To the ladies and gents out there who have skin issues similar to mine, maybe give this combo a try! Everyone’s skin is different, but with inexpensive travel sizes available, you may find this is the perfect one-two punch for you as well.

Then, the suction shelf that we have in the bathroom fell off the wall and it spilled all over the tub floor. We didn\'t realize it had fallen, so it might have been ""cleansing"" it for hours by the time we found it. However, when we did, it had pulled all the dirt out of the crevices in the tub floor like you would not believe. I thought my tub was bleached until I realized that it had actually just cleaned it THAT WELL. The bottom of the tub has those built-in grips which are the biggest pain in the butt to clean, and this cleanser dissolved the dirt in even the tightest areas. I figured that if this cleanser could do that to a tub, it\'s gotta be cleaning my pores like you would not believe.\nIt is a little strong, so I had to change my routine around a bit. I ""wash"" my face with micellar water in the morning, moisturize, and then follow with the cleanser at night and add a heavy moisturizer after. It brightens, tones, and cleans like a dream. It also lasts close to 6 months, even with twice daily use, so you get your money\'s worth. I have changed cleansers in the past, but I always come back to this.

It’s not oily feeling per se, but it has the (positive) attributes of an oilier cream in that it glides onto the skin and feels like it penetrates into the skin. That said, as someone with dry skin, I personally prefer something more hydrating and so for me personally this cream is s 3 but for many of you this would be a four or five because it is a good cream and is probably plenty hydrating for someone with normal skin. I also think the hydration level is probably fine for someone with moderately dry skin or in the summer when you don’t need as much product/hydration. Personally I think the best use of this product is for prepping your skin for a full face of makeup and if it was sold solely for that purpose I’d rate it higher (4 stars). My only issue with this product is that I feel it’s pricey for what it is. It reminds me a bit of Pond’s coldcream both in texture and in it’s scent. That said it is a FAR better quality in that Ponds Cold Cream is one of the few products that will give me a breakout and this product kept my skin clear and healthy looking. So overall it’s a good product, especially for skin-prep for makeup but I got mine for free from InfIuenster snd personally wouldn’t have purchased this type of product for this much money. FYI: I use drugstore face cream in the A.M. and high-end pricey products in the P.M. so I am open to both drugstore and willing to spend $$$ on high-end.

It melts and absorbs by the skin almost immediately, skin feels moisturized and plumped. And this feeling lasts all day. Even now, in the cold season. I don't see dry patches on my nose and cheeks anymore. Also it is a great base for makeup. The only downside of this product - it’s pricey. But 30 ml jar is gonna be good for about 2,5 months for me, so it’s not too bad. I absolutely love Cratlotte Tilbuty ’Magic Cream’ and will continue to use it with pleasure. I recommend!\n…read more""}, {'date': '18 Jan 2020', 'rating': 5, 'Skin Type': 'Dry', 'Skin Tone': 'Tan', 'text': 'Smells great without irritating my sensitive skin!

I tried to use this during the day and it never seem to sink in, but I used it both with and without retinol under my eyes st night, and overnight it sank in, leaving me with soft skin in the morning. Even though the retinol was irritating my face a little bit because it’s a new regimen, the under eye was not irritated at all. I can’t speak to dark circles or puffiness because lately I haven’t had those issues like I do sometimes, but it definitely moisturizers without being oily at night time. If you have dry skin this might be good during the day. I didn’t try it under make up because I didn’t think it would be suitable for my oily eyelids. However, I think this would be great for dry skin during the day and for all skin types at night when you need a little moisture, especially when using it retinol.

I noticed that in pictures my skin was smooth, glowing, even-toned, and my lines less noticeable to name only a few of the many improvements. I had started using a few new products along with the Creme de La Mer sample, so I thought nothing of it. Sure enough, my sample ran out and I stopped using it altogether. Even with my new intense skincare routine my skin started going downhill slowly. After a month without using La Mer I looked in the mirror one day and I felt discouraged because I was having breakouts again, my skin did not look as even, my skin just didn't look like it had before. It was the only thing I had taken out of my routine. So it's safe to say I made the investment and bought Creme de La Mer again. I bought the smallest size and I am going to drag it out as long as possible. I found that the amount I use doesn't seem to matter as long as I cover (even with the thinnest amount) most of my face.

Even if you only buy it once to get through the period of taking Accutane and switch to something less expensive when you\'re done, it is absolutely worth it. Accutane takes care of your acne from the inside (stopping oil production in the skin), but you need something to (1) heal your old scars and damaged skin caused by the numerous harsh topicals you\'ve used prior to starting Accutane, (2) to reduce inflammation, and (3) to provide restorative, long-lasting hydration to your skin (***This last one is really important*** Your skin still needs deep hydration to be healthy, clear, and glowing, but you don\'t want an ""oil free"" moisturizer that replaces good oils, which you administer proportionately with each application, with substitutes such as silicone. Silicone, for example, will clog your pores, causing acne and texture, if not thoroughly removed from the skin each night). I\'m almost done with Accutane. I\'ve seen 6 dermatologists and had cystic, painful acne for 15 years. I cannot believe I almost have movie start skin, truly. Accutane this moisturizer are no doubt the key.

Many of the negative comments come from people who either a) do not apply properly or b) think the cream causes breakouts. There is a science behind the creation, packaging and application of La Mer. I would suggest visiting their website for more information. Also, to those who say it causes breakouts, oftentimes your skin will purge when you use a different (or better) product. This is a common occurrence. After a few weeks your skin is like new, refreshed and glowing. I usually purchase the largest size available in department stores and it lasts forever!! A little bit goes a very long way. You will also see better results when you pair the moisturizer with a La Mer cleanser. I use the foaming cream, cleansing oil, cleansing gel or oil scrub depending on my needs that day or week. Another tip is to try a serum underneath to prep your skin. The Genaissance de la Mer is amazing and so is the renewal serum. I also use the eye cream and lip balm...they are the best on the market!! Bottom line: Creme de la Mer is not in everyone's budget, but if you want the healthiest, most radiant and softest skin of your life...start using this.

I\'ve been eyeing it for years (not an exaggeration) but the price always kept me away. My most recent regimen was by Rodan Fields. Prior to that I had tried products like No. 7, Vichy, and every drugstore brand you can think of. My skin is dehydrated, oily, I have large pores and endless blackheads. A bit of sun damage and ""mommy tiredness"" round out my look. I have been searching for something that will hydrate my skin, as the few fine lines I have really could benefit from moisture. Anti aging products I\'ve tried have left my skin dry. Enter La Mer. Upon first glance it seems pretentious - the brand has a colorful backstory, and the product contains ""miracle broth"" and is used by a ton of celebrities. It comes with special application instructions. It seemed foolish. The creme is thick like diaper paste and requires warming between your fingertips to emulsify it, at which point you pat/press the product into your skin. The first two times I tried this I got it wrong and ended up rubbing it in, which I immediately regretted as it\'s too thick and really you end up pulling on your skin to apply it. But once I got the hang of it, boy I really started to love bedtime. I only use this at night because I think it\'s too costly to use twice a day, and if I used it in the daytime I would also need a sunscreen product. At night I usually shower, cleanse, tone and La Mer my skin. It feels so luxurious. The next morning my skin looks refreshed and glowing. Best of all, it feels and looks hydrated! The only drawback for me is the price, but I don\'t believe I should give the product 4 stars based on that, because I do think the product is lovely. And because of it\'s paste-like texture I have a hard time using less product (to try to spare it along) because I need so much to rub between my fingers to emulsify it.

I have combination skin but with dry cheek and nose in colder months. My pores are also appeared smaller and my skin overall looks radiant and healthy, even without foundation! It doesn’t have any fancy function like whitening or anti-aging/firming, but this cream definitely makes your skin looks more supple! It didn’t give me any outbreak or worsen any if one or two popped up, in fact I think it might actually help with the healing and marks fading!

Doesn\'t make the price tag easier to swallow, but I\'ve totally drunk the Kool-Aid. I mostly use it at night because it\'s very thick and I have combo to oily skin (although I don\'t like the Soft Cream), and frankly I want it to last as long as humanly possible. If I don\'t use it one night, I immediately notice the difference in my glow, smoothness, and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles the next morning. That sealed the deal for me. Tried the Nivea dupe and it just doesn\'t compare. Fortunately a little goes a long way, and you MUST warm it up beforehand or it doesn\'t spread/absorb properly. I cleanse with micellar water or the Peter Thomas Roth anti-aging cleanser, then follow with Etude House toner and Drunk Elephant Framboos serum, then La Mer, and my skin looks incredible the next day, just lit from within, smooth, and with significant reduction in fine lines.

After a week of use my skin was never dry, tight, red nor flaky after cleansing. It really soothed my skin. I used it for about 6 weeks then I purchased the big bottle & a new more hydrating face wash plus a cleansing milk. Now, I cleanse my face, dab a cotton pad on my face with the cleansing milk then pick up any excess traces of the milk with cotton pad soaked with this rose toner. I also spray it on my face (after toning) before my oil. I found my oil worked a lot more doing this. I also spray it on my face before masking & after. I’ve never used it as a refresher for make up.

After using the product for a few days at a time on a couple of occasions, I’m overall fairly pleased with the result. The consistency of the product is unique and one of its strengths in my opinion—just slightly thicker than a typical toner liquid, but not not as think as a gel or creme; which seems to contribute to a more substantial hydration with more staying power than the water-like consistency of other toners. Additionally, it still dries fairly quickly, so as to not hold up the moisturizer step that will likely follow. A slight drawback of this product for me is the fragrance—both as an ingredient and the actual smell. Though the smell isn’t bad, it’s more pungent than what I would expect from a product advertised as having “sensitive” and “zen” qualities, though the toner is more mild in fragrance than the accompanying moisturizer in the same product line. (I’ll mention that I use primarily simple skincare, so I am typically more accustomed to a milder fragrance.) While I’m personally not particularly fond of a rose scent, this product certainly has notes of that rose fragrance, which seems to be really “in” right now. All in all, I am pleased with the product and while I received it complementary for testing purposes, I will continue to use it, as it has not caused any adverse reactions in my sensitive skin—though I’ll likely aim to mask the strong-ish fragrance by following with my more mild fragranced moisturizers overtop.\n…read more'}, {'date': '4 Aug 2018', 'rating': 3, 'Skin Type': 'Oily', 'Skin Tone': 'Fair', 'text': 'Eh Unlike the hydra zen moisturizer, I didn’t like this product.

One thing about La Mer is the concern of synthetic fragrances and dyes. There is less than 1% fragrance in this product which makes me feel better but there is red dye. Although it’s one of the last ingredients on the list, red dye is extremely irritating and can cause you to breakout. I ignored this fact because it was one of the last ingredients, but it did make my cheeks breakout in a way I’ve never seen before. Everyone who has acne prone skin is different, so if you want to try it maybe it’ll work better for you! And if it does break you out just switch toners and it’ll heal. Overall it’s an okay toner, but be careful if you’re acne prone.

I\'m going to start with the packaging, first impression not so good because SK-II what does that even means? I like to buy products that let me know right away with the name of the product what is it, at this point I assumed that it means skin and that\'s all I got, not sure about the II, the color of the box I guess is elegant but not my favorite, the instructions on the back of the box are so tiny that good luck to customers that can\'t see very good and don\'t own glasses for sure is going to become a challenge to read them, or the other option is to have somebody read them for you. The front of the box have I guess the description of what this product is ""Facial treatment, clear lotion"", well I will like as a customer more information, is going to clear what? And lotion? Sorry , but this is definitely not a lotion, more like a water, this is actually kind of misleading information to customers. Also, not sure if you can buy this product in a store, or just online, but in case you can how do I know if this product of for dry, oily or combination skin? Like I mentioned before, we need more information. The bottle is nice, love the silver cap and that the bottle is clear and you can see the product, love, love the dispenser, just a tiny hole that let you pour enough product into the cotton. Now to the product itself. I been using it on my face morning and night like the instructions indicate, I first apply on the T zone then the U zone and at the end on the neck from bottom to top, so basically doing the exact way they the product recommends, at the beginning I didn\'t even know what I was looking for, my skin was going to improve how? Will it help shrink my pores, make my skin smooth, get rid of pimples, etc, but after a couple of weeks I for sure noticed a different, my skin looks a little bit better, like there\'s glow in it and it also looks smoother, basically a lot healthier. I also noticed that it works great on my combination skin, it didn\'t dry the oily parts and it viceversa. Overall I think my skin has improved in many ways, my T zone and chin are not as oily, I love how is been helping me a lot on these 2 areas I truly believe is very hard to find a product that gives this type of improvement in such a little time of use, must of them take months, but I saw improvement in 1 week. I need to mentioned the fact that I didn\'t have any breakouts. Because is so easy and fast to apply I never forget to implement this in my daily routine. I like the fact that this product is free of synthetic fragrances and GMOs , no smell to it, to me this is great because sometimes these type of product scents are overwhelming, not with this product. GMOs are an ingredient that for sure Indo not want nowhere near my face, happy about this also. I also did some research into their main ingredient , Pitera, well apparently this like the miracle ingredient for skin rejuvenation, is basically a clear liquid rich in vitamins, amino acids, minerals and organic acids, that is very nutritious to the skin. I was very surprised after doing some research, that SK-II is distributed by P&G, didn\'t know they had a luxury skin care product, but guess now we know. Price, well, $99 dollars, a bit high, but I think that this bottle last a while, I guess it depends on how much product you pour on the cotton ball or whatever you use to apply, but I think that if you like the product and it helps you then go for it, is worth it.

I immediately appreciated how much product comes out with just a couple of shakes onto a cotton ball. Next, I appreciated how there is no scent, burning, or other sensation when applying. The feel is very natural going on, and just as natural after being applied. The reason I appreciated this is because I’ve tried products in the past that felt sticky or obvious after application. With this, you wipe it on and it absorbs quickly with no residue or stickiness after applying. After using it for a few weeks, I can say that I really like the results. You don’t realize it is doing anything because it is so simple going on and so subtle in how it works. I notice that my skin is a lot calmer since I first started using it. My skin seems less blotchy, smoother, more radiant. Again, it is very subtle in how it works, but one day the difference is noticeable. I didn’t realize how much of a difference it was making until today when I was eating at an outdoor café and someone I hadn’t seen in a while walked by. She stopped when she saw me and her immediate reaction was to compliment how great my skin looked. I was completely shocked. I knew it was working, but I didn’t really notice how well until she went on and on about my skin. I highly recommend this product. Again, it is so subtle that there may be a period where you’re not sure if it is even working, but I can assure you that it is. The con is the glass bottle.

I'm typically very oily with enlarges pores. I will say I don't get acne very often but I do have a little scarring from past breakouts. Every now and then my skin becomes super sensitive. This is one of those times. I will say that I was expecting more of a lotion consistency hence the name of the product. It is more like a toner. I was also a little nervous about using the product because right now my skin is super sensitive. I used my current cleansing product and then followed it up with the lotion. I noticed a couple of things immediately. First, it was very gentle. There was not burning or stinging like I have experienced before with other products. It was also fragrance free so there is no more dealing with medicinal smell other products can have. Upon inspecting the cotton ball I used to apply the product, I was able to see just how much left over dirt and residue was still left on my face after washing. I was grossed out and impressed all at the same time. The lotion quickly absorbed into my skin and left it feeling baby soft and smooth. There was no tacky or sticky feeling after it dried. I immediately followed up with my moisturizer. My moisturizer absorbed into my skin really well instead of just sitting on top of my skin. After completing everything I went about my day. Living it hot and humid Florida normally results in an oil slick on my face within 15 minutes of me following my normal wash routine. Things were quite different after using the lotion. I noticed that my skin was not oily whatsoever. I was in total disbelief. I thought that it was a fluke and my skin decided to have a good day. Well a good day turned into a good week and a good week turned into good weeks. Finally something to combat my oily skin. During the week I decided to defy the weather and wear makeup. For me this is the real test because Florida Heat and Humidity + Makeup = A Colorful Oily Mess. Well this product passed with flying colors. Again my oiliness has subsided and my makeup looked flawless. The application of my makeup was even smoother and more flawless. Originally, I suffered from sticker shock when I realized the price of it. Now I can't imagine my beauty routine without it.

I then apply another moisturiser on top.""}, {'date': '11 days ago', 'rating': 5, 'text': 'NICE LIGHT VERSION I like this light version of the cream. It feels light on the skin and does blend better than the rich version. For me personally I like this in the day and the rich version at night.

I use this overnight and I now could not be without it. I am a product junkie but nothing could sway me from this! It is rich and luxurious, plumps, hydrates and evens my skin tone. It also is great for relieving soreness and soothing irritation, nipping any spots or the likes in the bud for clear skin by morning. It is genius and cannot recommend it highly enough. Yes, it’s painful on your pocket, but will make waking up and looking in the mirror so much less so!'}, {'date': '16 days ago', 'rating': 5, 'text': 'MY NEW HG This cream is what I have been searching for.

Easy to apply and no reaction except a slight “pulling up” sensation on the cheeks. Downside was that a 5ml tube did one face and neck application and then one face only – and my skin could easily have absorbed it all in one go. Scaled up that would be a tube a fortnight!

It sinks in instantly, hydrates and makes my skin look fresh and super smooth. When I do breakout, it doesn't really do anything in regards to reducing/redness. But, it doesn't contribute to new breakouts which I have heard from friends can happen with the rich cream. I use Charlotte Tilbury's Light Wonder and it doesn't pill.

I typically use a fair few amount of products in my skincare routine, so it was initially hard having to ditch all the layering I do and rely solely on one cream. It was a tough call. I followed the rules. I cleansed my face morning and night and religiously applied 2 pumps of this on my face. I did this for the full 27 days. Whilst the rest of my skincare sat on my dressing table collecting dust. Which is where they will remain until I find suitable homes for them. Because, in all honesty I won’t be needing them anymore. This cream is like nothing else out there. And I can also honestly say that I never would’ve believed for one minute that just one product would have such a dramatic effect on my skin. My crows feet have diminished. The stubborn sun spots that I’ve had for years have faded to the point I can hardly see them. Some enlarged pores across my cheeks are virtually no longer.

It is incredible for oily/combination skins, it evens out skin tone and texture, provides the perfect amount of hydration and tackles stubborn blemishes/pigmentation and signs of premature ageing. If you are serious about investing in skincare, look no further, this is the holy grail.'}, {'date': '2 months ago', 'rating': 5, 'text': ""PROBABLY MY ALL-TIME FAVOURITE CREAM This has to be one of the best creams I've ever used! As soon as you apply it, it just sinks into the skin and creates a nice smoothing effect straight away. It's pleasantly moisturising without being too rich and I like to apply it on top of a light serum. It's even nice around the eyes because it's not too heavy at all. My favourite bit about it is that I can see the results on my fine lines after using it at night for the last 3 months or so. I use it on alternate nights with Sunday Riley's A+ Retinol and I think it would probably be perfect for daytime under makeup, but it's so pricey that I want to make sure it lasts for as long as possible so I stick to night-time use mainly.""}, {'date': '2 months ago', 'rating': 5, 'text': 'AMAZING!!!!

I was in Maine at the time I tried my sample. The air was cold and quite drying to my face and I was thrilled to have this product on hand! As soon as I applied the Soft Cream to my face, I felt a moisturizing effect immediately and the cream melted instantly into my skin. I loved how this product felt on my face! Regardless of the cold temperatures, my skin felt moist and dewy all day. Within days of use, the dry, irritated texture of my skin was now soft and smooth. I have tried many facial moisturizers in my time and none of them worked as well, not to mention, this quick. I was overly impressed in only a couple of days of using this cream. I immediately went out and purchased a full jar of the Lancome Absolue Soft Cream. It was a bit more than I was expecting to pay, but boy was it worth it. In a few weeks of using the cream, I have already noticed that the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and mouth are already starting to diminish. My skin looks healthy, brighter, more radiant overall and I have received many complements from friends and family about how great my skin looks. Now being in the warmer weather of Florida, the moisture holds up against heat and humidity without being greasy or feeling heavy on my skin. I absolutely love the soft cream and it seems to make my skin better with each day of use. Even my dermatologist wanted to know what I was using on my face because she said that I had a beautiful, radiant glow and my face has never looked better.

I also liked how it smelled. The only thing is, I couldn't find any directions on how to use the product. So I applied it to my face after I got out of the shower of an evening. It made my face feel tighter and after using it for a few weeks I've noticed the wrinkles around my eyes and forehead have slightly decreased. I would definitely buy the Absolue Revitalizing & Brightening Soft Cream and recommend it to others.""}, {'date': '5 months ago', 'rating': 2, 'Age': None, 'sex': None, 'Skin Type': None, 'Skin Tone': None, 'text': 'EHHH I was excited to try it when I looked it up because its supposed to be amazing and its very expensive.

Writing this review, I wonder if the prior product caused any interference with the way Absolue Revitalizing & Brightening Soft Cream worked. As I said, my skin was looking very dry when I started using Absolue Revitalizing & Brightening Soft Cream. After the 1st use, my skin seemed oily but still had the dry skin, I hoped it would clear up after a few uses. Unfortunately, not only did I still have skin that looked dry or peeled, but it became oily looking & the light lines I have on my forehead, between my eye brows & sides of mouth became deep wrinkles...smile lines some call them. When I used the Absolue Revitalizing & Brightening Soft Cream, I used it sparingly on my forehead, between my eyebrows, under my eyes (not as I would an eye cream, not close to eye) and on sides of mouth. Before I started with the last product, I had light lines in the places where I used both, not very noticeable, but to me they were....after using as mentioned I had deep lines. I stopped using it & my skin is back to what it was, so there was no permanent harm done. Even though it did not work for me, I still gave it 3 stars as everyone has different skin types & when I filled out the form, I may have put down I had combination skin, which I have had most of my life, but during the past month have come to realize it is just normal now, there are no dry & oily spots that combination skin has. Since my skin was not actually ""dry skin"" when I used Absolue Revitalizing & Brightening Soft Cream, I think it would be good for those with true dry skin (as I mentioned, mine was damaged from a previous product).
