Smells good and makes my hands feel clean. Has a nice lather.',\n",

This was important to me as I am asthmatic and VERY sensitive to strong scents. The sheets slide out easily and don't stick together. The travel case is small and relatively flat. Easily fits into small carrying spaces. Very portable. The only minus is that the case can be tricky to close if you have arthritis only because the closure is small and the case is lightweight so you have to be careful not to press too hard or you'll crack it. Not a deal-breaker, though. Great value for the money as there are 4 containers with 50 sheets per container. I've already mailed out 2 to family members and may just order another set of 4.

Make sure to grab one right before you start to watch your hands. I liked this product very much but the only thing I disliked was the little container it comes with. I assumed that it was like a silicon type container but it's really a hard cheap plastic. It's not easy to open unless you give it a slight squeeze on the sides and then open the front part. Other than that it is great! It's definitely easy carry in purse or pocket and very convenient especially when you walk into a place that has no soap. I would still recommend it.

Once I pushed closing apart , I found SUPER THIN pieces of paper I assumed where to be used with water to soapy up hands. I put in my hand and added TINY bit of water. The paper began to disappear within my hand and there was a little bit of foaming before all was gone. Then, when I went to dispenser to close , all I was able to do was try to put the top two pieces together again. There was no clicking, connecting etc. I would imagine, that pack wouldn\\'t take too long to have useless pieces of paper within.

The hands do feel a bit dry afterwards but I guess that is the LEAST of your concern when you just need the grime washed off of your hands.

If you're near camping, hiking, or water, you can keep it in a ziplock bag. The soap was rinsed well, and after washing, it always used moisturizers, but it didn't seem to dry its hands as much as other soaps. And I like it because my hands don't get slippery after writing.

The cylinder-shaped cases snap open and closed to protect the soap inside from getting wet or flaking apart when stored in a pocket or handbag.\\n\\nThe soap sheets tear easily along the serrated edge of the plastic cases, making for a neat, clean cut. They also dissolve quickly and completely under running water. (Don\\'t let the term \"paper\" concern you; there are no paper fibers left behind in the sink or sticking to your hands...just quick-dissolving, paper-thin rolls of soap sheets.)\\n\\nI really do think these portable little cases of soap sheets are a brilliant idea; and at $12 for a 5-pack, they\\'re a great value!

It’s convenient, and I like it. The small cylinders take up little space and weight. Because the soap is in a roll and completely within the plastic case, it is not exposed. The soap stays clean and dry, without cracking or flaking.\\n\\nYou lift the lid of the cylinder and pull off as much as you need, tearing it on the serrated edge of the case, then close the lid.\\n\\nBe careful, though, not to pull out more than you need, as you can’t push it back in without taking the case apart (not difficult but not convenient).\\n\\nThen just rub the soap sheet in your hands and the soap sheet will completely dissolve into regular soap.\\n\\nThe soap is scented, with different scents in each of the different cases. I prefer non-scented soap, but the scent is not strong and it does not last on my hands. Also, you can barely smell the scent on the sheets while in the case, so I don’t have to worry about it transferring scent to other items in my bag.\\n\\nThe claim is that these are “natural plant oil biodegradable environment material, pure natural plant extract,” so they should be safe to use with most water supplies.',\n",

You will dampen the entire package and basically just turn all the sheet back into a bar.\\n\\nThe fragrance on these wasn't terrible, but definitely geared more towards women than men or boys. Still we used them at scouts and handed one to each kid as they waited to wash up.\\n\\nSome got the idea right away that you wet the paper and your hands thoroughly and keep rubbing and scrubbing until it's all disintegrated. It made them wash for at least 20 seconds if not longer which was good. Unfortunately others tended to ball it up as soon as it got wet and then it would get dropped or leave small chunks stuck to their hands. There's definitely a learning curve with these.\\n\\nThe price for what you get it a pretty good value as long as you use them properly, unfortunately that's harder than it seems at first.\\n\\nThis is a fabulous idea for on the go hand washing where you don't want to touch a hand pump, or the bathroom is simply out of soap.

Bubbles and foam galore!',\n",

       " \"Really nifty idea | great scent | made in China Does anyone remember those mouthwash tabs that dissolved on your tongue, and basically gave you aggressively fresh breath? They were cool because they were teeny-tiny, came in a dispenser you could throw just about anywhere (even non-existent pockets in lady jeans), and were so portable and efficient that you could take them everywhere, secure in the knowledge of your superior hygiene. Well, these are basically the soap equivalent of that. Superior hygiene included.\\n\\nThese Fomin (ha, Fomin-- foaming??? is that a pun? I love it) soaps comes in sheets the size of a business card. I believe you get 100 per pack, so 300 total. I just love the idea of these because how many times have you gone into a restroom, found it was super gross... AND THERE WAS NO SOAP? I have, because San Francisco public restrooms are THE LITERAL WORST. I still have nightmares about some of them. With these soaps, you can just peel one off, wash your hands, and go on with your day feeling that much more clean in the middle of your soapmergency-induced panic.\\n\\nAlso, they smell really nice. The lavender one definitely overpowers the other two, but citrus and green tea are classic scents that are sometimes still somehow screwed up, and these both smelled really really nice. You could easily keep a pack of these in a purse or clutch, and they'd be a must if you're traveling, regularly rely on public restrooms, or to give away to someone as a cute and incredibly useful present (the packaging is lovely). I feel a little weird gushing about soap like this, but I love soap, and this is soap somehow made even more useful and amazing than it was already (imagine that???) so I am, of course, well chuffed.\",\n",
       " \"Each sheet is perfect for one adult hand wash, or hand and face. Really convenient. I've used a few sheets from each box...\\n\\nLavender - strongest scent, very soapy. Hangs around for over an hour.\\nOrange - very mild citrus scent.\\nTea Tree Oil - mild tea tree scent.\\n\\nAll three lather the same. The Lavender is a heavier foam, the orange the least foamy. All three clean really well. The sheets stick together - you'll need to be careful or you'll wind up using a couple at a time. Keep the sheets flat and don't ball them up - if they're folded or balled up they don't dissolve nearly as well.\\n\\nA half sheet works well for clean hands if you just want to wash up before or after a meal. These are ideal for camping, etc. Pack a few sheets in a snack-sized baggie and you're good to go. They DO have a strong scent in the package. Not as strong as a new bar of soap, but still pretty pervasive.\",\n",
       " \"Easy, fast, and portable So many soaps and sanitizers are packaged as liquids or bars -- inefficient, heavy, and messy. Using dry soaps seems like a no-brainer, and I am surprised that they are so hard to find. When I saw these soap papers on Amazon I ordered them right away, and they arrived just before I had to leave town. I had already been worrying about staying (relatively) clean, a major concern during a pandemic, since I would have limited access to running water. These sheets came in super handy during the trip.\\n\\nA three-pack: one for my travel bag, one for the car, and the third for one of my kids.

The scent (there are 3) are also subtle but nice.\\n\\nIt is great for traveling, and that is an understatement.\\n\\nMade in China',\n",
       " 'Very cool invention  I had seen these a few months ago while on my ever long quest to lessen my use of plastic and thought it was a really cool idea. These little sheets work really well! There’s three scents: lavender, tea tree, and orange. The scents are very strong and I only really like the orange, but I don’t mind the other scents enough to hate them. All you have to do is pull a sheet with dry hands, wet your hands, rub, and it dissolves into suds. Be careful of letting the sheet bunch because it will cause a clump that will take longer to dissolves. It’s very important that your hands are dry also, so there’s even a warning on the inside. These are perfect for beach trips that have bathrooms and camping!',\n",
       " 'So convenient, great scent and lather! These little boxes of soap sheets are so easy to carry and use when out and about. It is so important right now with covid to wash your hands thoroughly with good lather. These convenient soap sheets allow you to do that, no matter where you are. Just one sheet gives you enough lather to throughly clean both hands. And the scents are amazing! The orange is my favorite, but the lavender and tea tree are excellent too.\\nWe used soap sheets as a kid when we were camping and these remind me of those fun times. It shows just how practical these can be, you just need a little water and you can get cleaned up!\\nThese are a great buy and very useful!',\n",
       " 'Useful when traveling. I debate for a long time between 3 and 4 stars. I settled on 4 because I love the idea and they do work. These tissue sheets do lather very well and leave your hands smelling fresh. Best part for me, the scent does not linger more than a few minutes\\n\\nNow, I wanted to give 3 stars because it is very difficult to remove only 1 from the package. You must touch these tissue sheets with absolutely dry hands or the moisture will cause several to stick together. Did I mention to remove one, your hands MUST be dry After you remove 1, put it in one hand, wet the other hand, and then rub your hands together. Like magic, you have a nicely lathering soap. I also don\\'t love the cardboard packaging. For those who hike and travel, we know that somehow, no matter how hard we try something wet always gets in our bag. We figure this out when we take something out and it soaking wet. These tissue sheets are enclosed in a cardboard container and it is going to very difficult to use the entire package before one day you discover the entire box is a hard, wet mess.\\n\\nI decided to try these in the shower. I tried one and it lightly lathered my entire arm. Then, it was gone. So, I called the kid and said, give me 10 of those things. She put them in my wet hand and like magic, it turned into a \"bar of soap\". I was able to wash my entire body with this \"bar of soap\" stuck to my hand. So, if you are hiking and really need soap, these tissue sheets will work for a while.',\n",
       " 'Good to tryout. When I decided to buy this product, it was just out of curiosity. I found it interesting that they can make paper thin soap. When it arrived to my house, it came with 3 bags of soap and with different smell. I tried to use one slide of soap and it was a fun experience. One thing that I like about this product is that it was designed to make wash your hand for more 20 seconds. I would recommend this product to everyone.',\n",
       " \"So Convenient I'm so glad I got these. They are incredibly convenient. I keep one pack in my purse for those public bathroom trips & surprise! there's no soap. I also keep a package in my truck. The other is for use on my farm. All you need is water & you are good to go. I'm not crazy about fragrance being added to any product unless it's naturally sourced (herbs, essential oils, etc.). It was a concern when I ordered these. Thankfully, although scented, it's not strong. Also the scent doesn't linger which is great. I cannot stand overly toxic scented products that seem to seep into the skin & don't come out no matter how many times you wash.\\nOverall, a great product.\",\n",

       " \"These little soap thins are fantastic and work great! OK - where has this stuff been all my life? When we started trying this Fomin Soap Paper Premium 3-Pack and seeing how well this works, we were sold. We travel a lot, love to hike, and generally love all outdoor activities - and often those things land us in situations where we need to wash our hands, but don't have access to soap to fully clean them. Obviously, hauling a regular soap bar around to use gets too messy to be practical, so these little soap thins are just perfect for what we need.\\n\\nThe soap thins arrive in little packets of 100, and they are shaped and sized like a pack of gum. You simply pull one out (they are so super thin - exactly the thickness of thin paper!), add water, and it's perfectly portioned for a great lather and one time use each. My hands feel fresh and thoroughly clean after using them.\\n\\nThere are different scents in each pack of 100, and each smell wonderful and fragrant while still in the box. That said, once you pull out a soap thin and use it, our experience is that they really don't have much of a scent at all by themselves once the second they leave the box - and no scent lingers around after you use them. I'm assuming it's primarily the box that's scented and not the actual soaps?\\n\\nEither way, I more or less consider these closer to fragrance-free than anything else - and for my purposes, that's just fine. They work so great and are so convenient to have that I'm super happy with them. I have sensitive skin, and using these from time to time don't make me break out. They get two thumbs up from this household!\",\n",
       " 'Almost perfect Lathers up really well and leaves my hands soft. But parts of it have stuck to my hands and been REALLY hard to wash off, like having a clump of soap glued to your palm. Took a lot of effort to keep scrubbing off. Other than that, a useful product.',\n",

These little soap bars (thinly cut) are perfect and handy for those occasions when you have access to water but no soap. They dissolve easily because they're so thin and your hands feel so much better for it. In those pandemic times where there is a constant injunction to hand wash, having access to soap and water is essential.\\n\\nThe best part is the soaps themselves are so small they can easily be slipped into a jeans pocket. The only thing I didn't like was the excess wrapping - there was an outer wrap for each bar, PLUS a larger wrap for the whole set. I thought that was a bit much, environmentally wise. Otherwise, I highly recommend these.\",\n",
