Once I pushed closing apart , I found SUPER THIN pieces of paper I assumed where to be used with water to soapy up hands. I put in my hand and added TINY bit of water.

These packs of pocket size soap paper sheets remind me of the Listerine packs to freshen your breath, except a bit bigger in size. With the increased importance of maintaining good hygiene and frequent hand washing to reduce the spread of contamination, I like to keep these in my purse and give one to my parents or to my siblings in the event that they go somewhere and it is not convenient to go to a bathroom or sink to wash their hands or there is just no soap!

The only thing I would like to see it improved is if there could be some additional moisturizing agents added to this. The hands do feel a bit dry afterwards but I guess that is the LEAST of your concern when you just need the grime washed off of your hands. Also, I felt like the strips did not dissolve as well and it sort of just stuck to the skin in some parts and I had to really rub my hands together so it would dissolve, even when running under warm water.","[['increased', 1.1], ['importance', 1.5], ['good', 1.9], ['hand', 2.2], ['like', 1.5], ['no', -1.2], ['like', 1.5], ['improved', 2.1], ['grime', -1.5], ['like', 1.5], ['well', 1.1], ['stuck', -1.0], ['warm', 0.9]]"

This multi-pack comes with 5 rolls of soap sheets, each packed in a plastic holder that color-coordinates with the scent of the soap inside: green for green tea, blue for lily, purple for lavender, pink for rose, and pale yellow for lemon. The cylinder-shaped cases snap open and closed to protect the soap inside from getting wet or flaking apart when stored in a pocket or handbag.

The soap sheets tear easily along the serrated edge of the plastic cases, making for a neat, clean cut. They also dissolve quickly and completely under running water. (Don't let the term ""paper"" concern you; there are no paper fibers left behind in the sink or sticking to your hands...just quick-dissolving, paper-thin rolls of soap sheets.)

I really do think these portable little cases of soap sheets are a brilliant idea; and at $12 for a 5-pack, they're a great value! These should last me a while as we haven't been going out much due to COVID. But once they start running low, I'll definitely be ordering more!","[['solution', 1.3], ['cleverest', 2.6], ['frustration', -2.1], ['empty', -0.8], ['enthused', 2.0], ['protect', 1.6], ['easily', 1.4], ['neat', 2.0], ['clean', 1.7], ['cut', -1.1], ['no', -1.2], ['brilliant', 2.8], ['great', 3.1], ['value', 1.4], ['low', -1.1], ['definitely', 1.7]]"

Each little container is sturdy and small enough to stash anywhere, with a little hole through one end so you can make a keychain out of it.

Each colored container has soap of the same color (it doesn't show up on your hands), and they have different scents that are mild and pleasant.

They are easy to use. The sheets tear easily, the soap dissolves quickly and makes a good lather, and a little goes a long way.

My only issue with them is a couple of them didn't come with the sheet sticking out of the slot, so I had to wrestle with it a little to get it opened and adjusted. But in doing so, I discovered that there is a good sized roll in the container! With five in a pack, these will last a long time.

I travel a lot in third-world countries, where public bathrooms, when I can find them, seldom have soap, and if they do, it’s often a soggy bar that I don’t want to touch.

This is the first time I’ve seen soap sheets in this configuration. It’s convenient, and I like it. The small cylinders take up little space and weight. Because the soap is in a roll and completely within the plastic case, it is not exposed. The soap stays clean and dry, without cracking or flaking.

You lift the lid of the cylinder and pull off as much as you need, tearing it on the serrated edge of the case, then close the lid.

Be careful, though, not to pull out more than you need, as you can’t push it back in without taking the case apart (not difficult but not convenient).

Then just rub the soap sheet in your hands and the soap sheet will completely dissolve into regular soap.

The soap is scented, with different scents in each of the different cases. I prefer non-scented soap, but the scent is not strong and it does not last on my hands. Also, you can barely smell the scent on the sheets while in the case, so I don’t have to worry about it transferring scent to other items in my bag.

The claim is that these are “natural plant oil biodegradable environment material, pure natural plant extract,” so they should be safe to use with most water supplies.","[['clever', 2.0], ['want', 0.3], ['like', 1.5], ['exposed', -0.3], ['clean', 1.7], ['careful', 0.6], ['difficult', -1.5], ['strong', 2.3], ['worry', -1.9], ['natural', 1.5], ['natural', 1.5], ['safe', 1.9]]"

You really have to have clean dry hands to open one of these and dispense them out to the people with dirty or wet hands. There is just no good way to get only one sheet out by yourself if your hands are already dirty, and it's a big NO if your hands are wet at all. You will dampen the entire package and basically just turn all the sheet back into a bar.

The fragrance on these wasn't terrible, but definitely geared more towards women than men or boys. Still we used them at scouts and handed one to each kid as they waited to wash up.

Some got the idea right away that you wet the paper and your hands thoroughly and keep rubbing and scrubbing until it's all disintegrated. It made them wash for at least 20 seconds if not longer which was good. Unfortunately others tended to ball it up as soon as it got wet and then it would get dropped or leave small chunks stuck to their hands. There's definitely a learning curve with these.

The price for what you get it a pretty good value as long as you use them properly, unfortunately that's harder than it seems at first.

This is a fabulous idea for on the go hand washing where you don't want to touch a hand pump, or the bathroom is simply out of soap.

One packet is Sweet Orange, with soap sheets that have a mild citrus flavor.
One packet is Tea Tree Oil, with soap sheets that have a mild menthol-like scent.
One packet is Refreshing Lavender, with soap sheets that have a mild lavender scent.

Each sheet is paper thin. It's easy for me to mistakenly take out 2-3 sheets at a time, when I just needed one.

I find that once water comes into contact with a soap sheet, it disintegrates really quick.
There is minimal lather when I washed my hands with a soap sheet under running water.
With my hands wet, but not under running water, washing with a soap sheet gives moderate amount of lather.
After washing hands, the scents do not linger for long.

When my hands are greasy (from handling foods, for example), I need 4-5 sheets to get may hands cleaned. One sheet will not do.
Also, if my hands are wet, and I open the packet to get a sheet, the sheets behind it get wet and stick to each other, such that I end up grabbing 3-5 sheet as I try to take one sheet out. So, when I need to clean my hands, I will take out a 2-3 soap sheets, then wet my hands, and then use the sheets to wash my hands. This way, I don't waste soap sheets.

I find these most useful when I am commuting, and need to clean my hands. In instances like this, I take out 1-2 soap sheets, pour a bit of water from a water bottle, and clean my hands. This works wonderful!

Each packet is compact (I measure them a packet to be 3-1/4"" x 2-1/4""), easy to carry, and fits in a number of places inside my car. I can even fit it in my back pocket, and use it after I am done eating at my work place.

Lastly, the first several ingredients common to all 3 varieties are: sodium lauryl sulfate, tapioca starch, polyvinyl alcohol, aqua.

These Fomin (ha, Fomin-- foaming??? is that a pun? I love it) soaps comes in sheets the size of a business card. I believe you get 100 per pack, so 300 total.

With these soaps, you can just peel one off, wash your hands, and go on with your day feeling that much more clean in the middle of your soapmergency-induced panic.

Also, they smell really nice.

I debate for a long time between 3 and 4 stars. I settled on 4 because I love the idea and they do work. These tissue sheets do lather very well and leave your hands smelling fresh. Best part for me, the scent does not linger more than a few minutes

Now, I wanted to give 3 stars because it is very difficult to remove only 1 from the package. You must touch these tissue sheets with absolutely dry hands or the moisture will cause several to stick together. Did I mention to remove one, your hands MUST be dry After you remove 1, put it in one hand, wet the other hand, and then rub your hands together. Like magic, you have a nicely lathering soap. I also don't love the cardboard packaging. For those who hike and travel, we know that somehow, no matter how hard we try something wet always gets in our bag. We figure this out when we take something out and it soaking wet. These tissue sheets are enclosed in a cardboard container and it is going to very difficult to use the entire package before one day you discover the entire box is a hard, wet mess.

I decided to try these in the shower. I tried one and it lightly lathered my entire arm. Then, it was gone. So, I called the kid and said, give me 10 of those things. She put them in my wet hand and like magic, it turned into a ""bar of soap"". I was able to wash my entire body with this ""bar of soap"" stuck to my hand.

OK - where has this stuff been all my life? When we started trying this Fomin Soap Paper Premium 3-Pack and seeing how well this works, we were sold. We travel a lot, love to hike, and generally love all outdoor activities - and often those things land us in situations where we need to wash our hands, but don't have access to soap to fully clean them. Obviously, hauling a regular soap bar around to use gets too messy to be practical, so these little soap thins are just perfect for what we need.

The soap thins arrive in little packets of 100, and they are shaped and sized like a pack of gum. You simply pull one out (they are so super thin - exactly the thickness of thin paper!), add water, and it's perfectly portioned for a great lather and one time use each. My hands feel fresh and thoroughly clean after using them.

There are different scents in each pack of 100, and each smell wonderful and fragrant while still in the box. That said, once you pull out a soap thin and use it, our experience is that they really don't have much of a scent at all by themselves once the second they leave the box - and no scent lingers around after you use them. I'm assuming it's primarily the box that's scented and not the actual soaps?

Either way, I more or less consider these closer to fragrance-free than anything else - and for my purposes, that's just fine. They work so great and are so convenient to have that I'm super happy with them. I have sensitive skin, and using these from time to time don't make me break out.

The packs are small enough to put in your pocket or purse. The scents are nice and not overpowering. It doesn't lather up like crazy but rather just enough. It comes with these little packs of what I believe to be compressed towels but I haven't opened one yet (the pink packets shown in the pic). The only negative thing I found is that they dry your hands out so just make sure you have some lotion to put on afterward. That's not anything that would stop me from using them though. I hope this helps.,"[['great', 3.1], ['great', 3.1], ['nice', 1.8], ['like', 1.5], ['crazy', -1.4], ['negative', -2.7], ['sure', 1.3], ['stop', -1.2], ['hope', 1.9], ['helps', 1.6]]"

It’s nice that it also has miniature compressed towels. Really useful in some cases.","[['good', 1.9], ['great', 3.1], ['no', -1.2], ['like', 1.5], ['clean', 1.7], ['nice', 1.8], ['useful', 1.9]]"

My Family recently went camping and we each had a packet of these soap strips. These came in handy for washing our hands before cooking, after eating, after using the loo, and every time otherwise. They don't have a strong enough smell to cover the smell of camp water or fish, but they later really well and your hands are easily cleaned.
I definitely recommend these. I'll be ordering more so my Family is stocked for any trips we take.","[['perfect', 2.7], ['strong', 2.3], ['well', 1.1], ['easily', 1.4], ['definitely', 1.7], ['recommend', 1.5]]"
