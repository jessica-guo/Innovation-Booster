I have Normal skin and it hydrates my skin perfectly without making me oily or greasy or too dry. For me, it gives just the right amount of hydration but I have been told that I have normal skin. If you have skin that is either super oily or super dry, you might need to use a different cream. It is expensive, but a little goes a long way. I do think that a fragrance free version might benefit some people better. There is fragrance in this, and I don't mind the smell at all but I have super bad allergies in the summertime and it does make me sneeze a little. My skin is softer, smoother and more supple after using this. I bought this cream for line & wrinkle prevention though and I wish I could tell if it really helps with that. I'm in my mid 20's with no *current* wrinkles but I do want a lot of aging prevention. There's no existing lines on my face to diminish or make disappear, so (it's hard to tell if it will help with that, I can't see any before & after because there were no wrinkles to start with) I really do hope that it actually helps with that. But everything I've seen with my skin since using this has been positive, and it feels amazing (looking forward to moisturizing everyday) so I will continue to use it and re-buy. I've also tried a variety of mid range to expensive creams on the market, if that helps anyone, and I still feel that this is a good cream. I'd love to see photos of it truly helping diminish & prevent wrinkles though, since that is my main concern.\\n…read more\"},\n",

       "  'text': 'SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I purchased this moisturizer along with three other products to combat fine lines and extremely dry, flakey skin I developed while pregnant. I never saw any significant results to be honest and so I switched to the Versed moisturizer after I was about 90% done with the product. Since switching I’ve seen a MASSIVE difference in my skin, no more flaking, fine lines have faded, brighter complexion to name a few changes. However I didn’t immediately place blame on the Magic Cream as I had introduced a lot of other products into my routine. I ran out of the Versed one and began using what I had leftover from the CT and this is what compelled me to write this review. With only 3 days of use, dry and flaking patches have returned all over my cheeks and forehead and a bumpy texture has developed on my cheeks. This is the only thing that has changed in my routine in the past 3 days. I am now convinced that this cream does less than nothing for $100. Save your money and your skin and invest elsewhere as I am sure now more than ever you are paying for packaging and certainly not a product that does anything is claims to - not even at a minimum does it moisturize\\n…read more'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Incredible under makeup or sunscreen This is one of those products where the formulation makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts. The ingredient list, the fragrance, the hype all would make you think this is just a \"youtube made me buy it situation.\" I tried it a few months ago, loved it, but resisted buying it again. Then I received a deluxe sample from influenster. And based on my experience with the magic crystal serum elixer and its effect on makeup, I decided to try it again. I stand corrected. It\\'s super thick, I don\\'t use it at night because I use something simpler with my acids and trentinoin. But in the am, after all my actives, hydraters, and oils, I use a super small amount as my moisturizer. It sinks in immediately. Pairs well with my multi-step routine, but best of all, it makes my sunscreen sit better and LOOK better than any of my (equally expensive but less hyped) moisturizers. So much so that a couple of sunscreens and primers that I thought didn\\'t work for me now look amazing. So with this, sunscreen and a little primer, I can have a bare face day. OR I can wear this with foundation and makeup and my skin looks amazing and fresh, my foundation applies better and sinks in better, and lasts longer. Even on busy work days. And I find that when I wear full coverage foundation (not often), my skin feels less dried out and clogged if I wear this first. And I use so little that I reckon a 1.7 ounce jar will last me a solid 6 months minimum, which makes the cost per use more palatable.

I have sensitive skin—perhaps that is the issue. All I really got out of using this cream for a few weeks was breakouts and a layer of oil on top of my dry skin. The cream didn’t settle into my skin very well after massaging it into my face. Putting SPF and foundation on top of that just made it worse. Again, I am reading some good reviews here, so it could just be the cream was incompatible with my sensitive skin.

It is heavier than other hydrating creams but it actually absorbs pretty fast. I do see a light glow after I apply it. Overall I really like it. I will continue to use and see if it keeps working. It only gets four stars because for its price there are other moisturizers that achieve the same results for less.\\n…read more'},\n",

I have been using it day and night after my CT Magic Crystal Serum Elixir and I am in love!!

It definitely hydrated and plumped my skin, giving an extremely glowy finish, and I now know why she uses it on all of her clients before makeup. And the makeup sits extremely well over top, and I even tested it with my most finicky foundations that normally have problems with applying over thicker dewy moisturizers. So two thumbs up there. My ONLY issue is the fragrance ingredient, which is why I have it only 4 stars. If that is removed from this formula then this moisturizer truly would be magical.\\n…read more'},\n",

I received CHARLOTTE TILBURY Magic Cream Moisturizer as a sample. I was excited to try because it’s a very expensive cream and receives many good reviews. The first time I tried, I was surprised how greasy it was. Not dewy, but greasy, in my opinion. I used Marc Jacobs Shameless foundation with Marc Jacobs Coconut Primer, but the cream was too greasy and foundation and concealer did not stay beautifully as usual. Next time, I skipped the primer and used the liquid foundation directly after using the magic cream. Still felt greasy. I used silicon primer, not the Marc Jacobs Coconut Primer, but still felt greasy. Only thing I can think of is that maybe this magic cream is good with cream foundation? Something with a thicker consistency like stick foundation? I love CHARLOTTE TILBURY’s makeup products. I really tried to love this cream. That’s why I used this cream in many different ways.

It’s super luxurious aesthetic will encourage everyone to use it. My main concern is how one cream can by the holy grail? I feel that I would have to use this product for at a minimum 3 months or at least 2 jars before one can determine the full results and benefits from it. I use a lot of makeup and live in a humid environment so it may not be conducive here. I wish that it brighten my skin more and had a slight color corrector like a pink hue to warm up my pale yellow skin. All in all it is not bad for those who does not want to pick from many different variety of moisturizer from a single brand, so having the “one and done” is perfect for those who may not have the need to have substantial active ingredients in their skincare. #Influenster\\n…read more'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Good for Makeup Prep / Too Pricey Overall The CT Magic Cream is a good face cream which moisturizes without being too heavy, in fact the lightness of the product is one of its most appealing attributes. It’s not oily feeling per se, but it has the (positive) attributes of an oilier cream in that it glides onto the skin and feels like it penetrates into the skin. That said, as someone with dry skin, I personally prefer something more hydrating and so for me personally this cream is s 3 but for many of you this would be a four or five because it is a good cream and is probably plenty hydrating for someone with normal skin. I also think the hydration level is probably fine for someone with moderately dry skin or in the summer when you don’t need as much product/hydration. Personally I think the best use of this product is for prepping your skin for a full face of makeup and if it was sold solely for that purpose I’d rate it higher (4 stars). My only issue with this product is that I feel it’s pricey for what it is. It reminds me a bit of Pond’s coldcream both in texture and in it’s scent. That said it is a FAR better quality in that Ponds Cold Cream is one of the few products that will give me a breakout and this product kept my skin clear and healthy looking. So overall it’s a good product, especially for skin-prep for makeup but I got mine for free from InfIuenster snd personally wouldn’t have purchased this type of product for this much money. FYI: I use drugstore face cream in the A.M. and high-end pricey products in the P.M. so I am open to both drugstore and willing to spend $$$ on high-end. This product just doesn’t feel like s high-end product to me and therefore isn’t worth the high price-tag.\\n…read more'},\n",

This regimen has kept the situation from getting worse, but there hasn't really been any reversal.  Enter Magic Cream.  I was sent a product sample to evaluate, and I am SO glad this happened.  I was skeptical at first, because the cream is much thicker, closer to a creamy balm than a moisturing cream, than I expected.  However, it doesn't wear thickly on the face, and doesn't interfere with my foundation.  Furthermore...I found that after seven days, I didn't even need to wear foundation!  My skin tone was naturally evened out and looks beautiful in its natural state.  And, after seven days, there was a definite improvement in my fine lines and creases, you can see it in the picture.  There are no filters, foundations or creams in the pictures, both pictures are au natural.

It’s so tiresome trying this cream and that only to find it pilling under your foundation. This magic cream absorbs so well into your skin, it feels like satin on your skin. I allow a few minutes to absorb fully before applying CC cream or primer. I want my skin to fully absorb the nutrients. I use the tip of my tweezers to take a dab of cream for my face. It’s rich and a little really goes a long way. If I feel especially dry I’ll apply more. I’ve noticed my makeup goes on way better. Smoother. No dry patches. I just love this cream. For the price, I can make it last a long time. It has a mild scent -barely there- but if you’re super sensitive to that you will notice. This cream will be part of my forever routine.\\n…read more'},\n",

       "  'text': 'Perfect Moisturizer for Combination Skin! This is a game changer. This cream is dense in texture but if you use a little bit - it rubs in quite light overall. But even the small amount that I use amazingly hydrates the skin and has a calming effect for the skin. I definitely use it for makeup — after toner and an essence of some kind, and then the moisturizer. But you do have to allow for 10 minutes or so for it to fully absorb into the skin before applying primer, then your foundation. For nighttime, it works great but I wouldn’t mind even more moisture. It’s pricey, so I’m loathe to use more in amount. After 2 weeks of usage, I find that my skin has calmed down, and feels refreshed. I don’t have any active acne right now so I can’t comment on that — but the scarring I have from past acne has faded considerably. Note that there is a heavy scent to the moisturizer...smells a little like a strong rose plus some medicinal type scents. It’s not terrible but it’s not really appealing either. But within minutes, it goes away. Something to keep in mind if you’re sensitive to fragrance, which I am not.\\n…read more'},\n",

I never realized until i used this...my old drug store moisturizer felt like it was sitting on my skin rather than soaking in like this moisturizer does. I will say, a little goes a LONG way. The first time I applied, I put entirely too much and ended up covering my face, neck and chest. I recommend putting a dot on forehead, then a dot on each cheek then build up from there if more is needed. I also started using a retinol every night and although this is technically a day cream, I use at night as well after the retinol since it’s so creamy. I was expecting my skin to be dry due to the retinol but I believe this cream has saved that. My skin looks more plump and glowy and just feels healthier.\\n…read more'},\n",

I have oily skin and I am a middle-aged, but my concerns are puffiness, dark circles, anti-aging, and moisturizing. I tried to use this during the day and it never seem to sink in, but I used it both with and without retinol under my eyes st night, and overnight it sank in, leaving me with soft skin in the morning. Even though the retinol was irritating my face a little bit because it’s a new regimen, the under eye was not irritated at all. I can’t speak to dark circles or puffiness because lately I haven’t had those issues like I do sometimes, but it definitely moisturizers without being oily at night time. If you have dry skin this might be good during the day. I didn’t try it under make up because I didn’t think it would be suitable for my oily eyelids. However, I think this would be great for dry skin during the day and for all skin types at night when you need a little moisture, especially when using it retinol.

No dryness at all. And it pairs well with the La Mer foundation too. If you have super dry skin this is the moisturizer for you!!! Pricey but worth it.\\n…read more'},\n",

They are found in Vaseline which can cost $1. Glycerin is also a top ingredient which is great, but again, nothing special. Glycerin is found in the most basic moisturizers. This also has citrus extracts which are extremely irritating and are basically fragrances. Fragrance is also in this, however, it is the very last ingredient so it's not too big of a deal. But the citrus extracts are fragrant and irritating in themselves. This cream isn't worth the high price tag. There are SO many creams here at Sephora or even the drugstore that have amazing long term benefits with much more special ingredients. There's not even hyaluronic acid in this... even though it's nothing special, it's still an amazing humectant that belongs in moisturizers. This cream is personally not worth the money.

That might explain the uncomfortable sensation of wearing this product and certainly explains the blackheads. I wouldn’t recommend it unless you have dry or mature skin.

I would recommend it if you have severely dry skin, dry and/or irritated patches of skin from the elements or sensitized skin. I would also recommend this for mature skin. A little goes a very very long way. One small jar lasts for years so if you want to try it, start with a sample size. You will have plenty of time to see how you like it and how your skin reacts to it and won’t run the risk of larger sizes becoming expired. For me, this is much too heavy for daytime use and makes my normal to combination acne prone skin look greasy fast. I don’t think it wears nicely under makeup either. So I only use it at night.

I’ve been using nivea creme for the past month to help with very dry winter skin and have loved the feel and results. I find both a tad on the thick side which creates a lot of tugging on the skin unless you have the patience to pat on your moisturizer. I’ve been adding about 4 drops of kiehls midnight repair serum (another must have) and it really helps to thin it out enough for a smoother application (highly recommend). And in 100% honesty after having tried both I prefer the nivea creme. When it dries it doesn’t leave a residue on my skin which I found la mer does and makes it hard to apply makeup on. And the other obvious con is the price. Other then that these products are practically identical right down to the scent. I am honestly shocked so many people would choose la mer over nivea. It’s practically the same creme minus the price tag.\\n…read more'},\n",

That being said, there is absolutely no reason for this price tag. The sample lasted me for a month and it didn\\'t do anything special for my skin. Some of my favorite moisturizers do more to hydrate and smooth my skin throughout the day and are at least 60% cheaper than this product.

I have very dry, sensitive skin, and once I started using it, I noticed a difference in my skin very quickly. Because of the cost, I tried many other products that my favorite staff at Sephora told me are \"similar\" - which they might be for women who\\'s skin isn\\'t as dry and sensitive as mine (I would LOVE to save some money!). But none of them worked as well. Basically, I went from having skin issues to having perfect skin. I don\\'t think everyone will have such dramatic results, because not everyone needs such a rich cream. The Soft Cream is less rich, and I know people with normal or oily skin who really like it. I love the other La Mer products as well (the serum is awesome) and look forward to promotions that include large samples, but the 2 ounce original cream is always in my medicine cabinet. Even with nothing else, it\\'s all I really need. For those who love La Mer, FYI a few times a year La Mer does a promotion where a 2 ounces jar comes in a gift set with a .5 ounce jar - I usually try to make mine last until then because an extra .5 ounces is a huge savings :) Sometimes this is offered in stores (I first saw at Bloomingdales) but it\\'s also on their website, which has free shipping and usually some gift with purchase. With the amount I was spending on products I didn\\'t love, and facials, etc, buying this is not as crazy as it sounds. One and done, every day. Hope this is helpful!\\n…read more'},\n",

Unfortunately, La Mer uses a lot of this ingredient, and I'm allergic to it. :( I was horrified to check the label and find that it contained the extract. I also noted that, for an awfully expensive product, it contains mineral oil. Yikes.

It's so expensive I thought either it has gold in it or people are getting ripped off here. I WAS WRONG. I received a sample of this and used it religiously every night for about a month. The sample was small so I really stretched it out. I started getting tons of compliments about my skin. I noticed that in pictures my skin was smooth, glowing, even-toned, and my lines less noticeable to name only a few of the many improvements. I had started using a few new products along with the Creme de La Mer sample, so I thought nothing of it. Sure enough, my sample ran out and I stopped using it altogether. Even with my new intense skincare routine my skin started going downhill slowly. After a month without using La Mer I looked in the mirror one day and I felt discouraged because I was having breakouts again, my skin did not look as even, my skin just didn't look like it had before. It was the only thing I had taken out of my routine. So it's safe to say I made the investment and bought Creme de La Mer again. I bought the smallest size and I am going to drag it out as long as possible. I found that the amount I use doesn't seem to matter as long as I cover (even with the thinnest amount) most of my face. My skin is once again almost completely FLAWLESS. I could throw out all my other products. I'm not kidding. Because it has been such a miracle for my skin I have been using it on my arms. I pick at my arms when I get anxious (it's a horrible habit I know). I wear long sleeves usually to hide the marks. I have put Creme de La Mer on it for a few nights and The scars have already faded DRAMATICALLY. It works.

Again, immediately upon application I felt like my face was on fire and I ran to the sink to wash it off. My last hope was that half-used jar of La Mer sitting on my vanity that I hadn’t touched in ages. Omg, it not only didn’t irritate my skin, it actually soothed it. Within minutes my skin was noticeably less red and felt less inflamed.

I've also used Nivea Creme (directly imported from Germany) and the results are nowhere near the same, as Nivea leaves an oil slick, and this does not. My face is often tight, dehydrated, and combination oily... but if I use this cream, I am relatively great by the end of the day.

And my newly home-extracted , bound-to-be-crusty-and -inflamed wounds on my face all flattened, and the new scars disappeared! Fast forward a decade to last week, I used retinal for the first time for 7-days straight, along with my regular acids and physical exfoliation (terribly bad idea). In combination with my hormonal breakouts, I felt like a zombie whose face was about to melt off. I stopped all products and just went for the La Mer concentrate followed by a big scoop of this cream. I did the same thing the next morning, and when I took off my makeup tonight I was shocked! My scars quite obviously faded, my skin tone was more even and generally brighter, and my entire face looked plump and hydrated with even smaller pores! My face looked like it just enjoyed a nice sheet mask and not covered in makeup for 13 hours. Just two uses was able to repair my zombie-apocalypse face and made it look much better than before. I don’t use it regularly, only when my face is in need of desperate recovery, and this cream never fails. People say that there are too much petroleum, and it’s overpriced for it’s ingredients, but until I find a cheaper equivalent that can do what this cream does to me, I’ll always keep a little jar in my cabinet.\\n…read more'},\n",

But, after using it for a few months what I did notice was small white heads on my face which a Sephora skin care specialist told me is happening because I am either using too much product or this creme is drowning my pores. Now, I have dry skin (and I am 40) so I got this knowing that it is very hydrating, and I have been using it just the way I was instructed to (put a small pea size in your hand, melt it in your hand and pat on face). Overall, it does smell good and feel good just because it reminds me of my childhood (using Nivea, lol!) but I just don\\'t know that it works. I don\\'t understand these reviews on Sephora lately. I feel like there may be too many people getting free products and writing \"good\" reviews.

I don’t really have super problem skin, but it’s extreme combination (very oily t zone, very dry cheeks) and very uneven - since I am so fair I’m very prone to redness and any imperfections in my skin are very visible (discoloration/uneven tone). My skin is also super sensitive and reacts easily. I literally saw effects overnight - put it on before bed and I woke up to a glowing & supple complexion. All redness was gone, pores invisible, and my skin felt amazingly hydrated. I was honestly in shock that something could do that to my skin overnight. I didn’t want it to be true because this cream is soooo expensive, but it really is a holy grail product if there ever was one. I got the mini since it was the least expensive. It’s a pretty thick cream and a little goes a long way so I am hoping this will last me a month.

My skin regimen is not for the faint of heart. My skin care is anywhere from 7 to 10 steps. So I figured incorporating an amazing moisturizer might be the key to see an even greater difference. Through my skin care I have gone from oily to combo oily. Although I did like the moisturizer I feel like I have not seen a big enough difference. I have acne prone skin and while I am happy to say has not caused any more acne I feel like the rest of my skin care has caused a bigger difference than this moisturizer. Now if I was rich and had money to blow I would definitely continue buying this hoping that maybe I might see a difference. However the price I do not think it is worth it so much. Like if I was rich and wanted to live in luxury then I would buy it. I’m not saying it’s a bad moisturizer it’s actually a good one. But I feel like it might be better for someone with really dry skin or for someone that is really only considering their moisturizer as their main component of skin care almost. For example maybe someone that has a very simple routine can benefit more from a higher end Moisturizer. Yet since my skin Routine is extensive I really don’t see this moisturizer making much of a difference. Maybe when I get older and maybe I get a little dryer I might re-purchase this.\\n…read more'},\n",

Now, i highly regret using other moisturizers and serums because this is really a miracle all-in one cream. I’m obsessed with the texture, and you won’t find anything else like it. It’s the richest cream I’ve ever felt! A tiny dab goes a long way. It smells luxurious like a fresh dewy marine scent but it’s very subtle. It applies like butter and leaves your skin plump and silky hydrated. I use it all over my face, my neck, and under-eye contour area. My makeup applies perfectly smooth and holds up longer than with regular moisturizer, serums, or primers. It doesn’t irritate my adult acne or clog my pores. it actually has a smoothing effect on my pores and I’ve noticed my blemishes and redness decrease when I use Crème de La Mer. It’s the type of cream that you’ll become addicted to and look foreword to in you’re skincare routine. I really can’t live without it, even though I’ve gone “clean” and cruelty free—I can’t give this up! It’s magic.

And it does absorb into my skin quite easily; I was able to apply makeup a few minutes after my morning application which was surprising. I found during the first week that my skin was looking dewy which was exciting. However, after the first week of use, I started waking up with tight, dry skin which wasn't happening before switching to la Mer. I even had to start applying a facial oil before applying la Mer because the la Mer just wasn't enough on its own... my skin was becoming drier and drier. This is absolutely not what I anticipated from such an iconic product. If I hadn't been using my PTR C serum for the last 6 months, which has been a game changer for my skin, perhaps I would've seen more improvement in my skin tone. The reviewers that claim that la Mer dramatically calmed their skin down makes me think they were unknowingly using something previously that was inflammatory. For a product at this price point, I cannot justify having to also use an expensive vitamin c serum AND add in a facial oil to compensate for the drying effects of long term use of this product. La Mer also did absolutely nothing for the fine lines on my forehead. So what am I left with? Dewy skin in the first few hours after application, but overall drier skin than before starting this product and a need to find something for my fine lines. Overall, not worth it at all.

It was thick to the point of being a little difficult to spread. I found this to be a sticking point because it wasn't really quick to use on my eye area. Also, I tend to be suspicious of creams that are overly thick because it simply means they are full of thickening agents. I also didn't care for the smell. It smelled just like a drugstore brand that my mom used to use which I never liked. (It came in a blue jar with white lettering.) What I was impressed with was that it made my area noticeably plumper. Although I must say that the cream left the area moist since it's so thick. Thus, I wouldn't use this during the day. I was further impressed by how even my skin-tone was around my eyes. I couldn't stop looking in the mirror. For those two reasons, I seriously thought about purchasing this product. However, a few things held me back. I did some research and it looks like this contains potentially irritating ingredients like eucalyptus oil.

I use a q tip instead of the spatula. So far, I haven’t noticed any break outs from this despite mineral oil and it honestly sinks into my skin and keeps it dewy and moisturized without feeling like there’s a layer of moisturizer on top of your skin.

The reason for not 5-stars. 1) When I first got it, I applied over my entire face, but noticed the next day some clogged pores on my nose. I am confident that the La Mer caused it because it was almost instantaneous. 2) The second reason is because I am dubious of what it implies with this so called \"Miracle Broth™\" that is supposed to strengthen and renew, etc etc. I think that is probably just some marketing speak. Also, I\\'m guessing that it is produced for much lesser than we know and thus doesn\\'t warrant the price tag--again part of the marketing and advertising genius.

Many of the negative comments come from people who either a) do not apply properly or b) think the cream causes breakouts. There is a science behind the creation, packaging and application of La Mer. I would suggest visiting their website for more information. Also, to those who say it causes breakouts, oftentimes your skin will purge when you use a different (or better) product. This is a common occurrence. After a few weeks your skin is like new, refreshed and glowing. I usually purchase the largest size available in department stores and it lasts forever!! A little bit goes a very long way. You will also see better results when you pair the moisturizer with a La Mer cleanser. I use the foaming cream, cleansing oil, cleansing gel or oil scrub depending on my needs that day or week. Another tip is to try a serum underneath to prep your skin. The Genaissance de la Mer is amazing and so is the renewal serum. I also use the eye cream and lip balm...they are the best on the market!! Bottom line: Creme de la Mer is not in everyone's budget, but if you want the healthiest, most radiant and softest skin of your life...start using this. You will never stop and you will not regret it!!\\n…read more\"},\n",

Sometimes that would happen and other times it would still stay a whitish color. Idk why it’s so complicated for me lol but that is part of the process that is supposed to make this miracle like. I don’t know that I saw a huge difference in my skin after the first jar, however without make up I did get compliments on how my skin looked ( I don’t have break out or blemishes..I’m in my mid 30s so my focus is mainly hydration, evening skin tone and anti aging benefits) However the time came when I ran out and I decided to see if I could find something comparable that was less expensive.

My skin looks so much better than it ever has; no more flaking, and my once bright red cheeks now look like they have a soft blush. Makeup goes on so much nicer, too!

Here's what's good about it: it is very moisturizing without making my skin oily, if you stretch it reeeeally thin you can use it under makeup, it smells clean (reminds me of the original Nivea body cream), and it doesn't irritate my crazy sensitive skin! There are some things I didn't care for: 1. the consistency is too thick for my taste and I don't like having to use too much product on my face. When I didn't use a good amount of cream I didn't feel like my skin was moisturized enough and felt the need to add an oil on top. It's a good cream but there are so many really good options out there for way less money. I cannot say that La Mer gave me more of a glow either. My skin glows anyway on my good days but that is because I use a good lactic acid and a vitamin c serum, products proven to work time and time again.

For those who do not know exactly what these are, these compounds help run the engines of your car, lawn mower and other small engine equipment you may own. And you\\'re putting it on your body. It is cheap for cosmetic companies to obtain and since they are so high up on the ingredient list, most of the product is made up of them.

       "  'text': 'Luxury in a jar After trying numerous other skincare lines I finally splurged on La Mer. I\\'ve been eyeing it for years (not an exaggeration) but the price always kept me away. My most recent regimen was by Rodan Fields. Prior to that I had tried products like No. 7, Vichy, and every drugstore brand you can think of. My skin is dehydrated, oily, I have large pores and endless blackheads. A bit of sun damage and \"mommy tiredness\" round out my look. I have been searching for something that will hydrate my skin, as the few fine lines I have really could benefit from moisture. Anti aging products I\\'ve tried have left my skin dry. Enter La Mer. Upon first glance it seems pretentious - the brand has a colorful backstory, and the product contains \"miracle broth\" and is used by a ton of celebrities. It comes with special application instructions. It seemed foolish. The creme is thick like diaper paste and requires warming between your fingertips to emulsify it, at which point you pat/press the product into your skin. The first two times I tried this I got it wrong and ended up rubbing it in, which I immediately regretted as it\\'s too thick and really you end up pulling on your skin to apply it. But once I got the hang of it, boy I really started to love bedtime. I only use this at night because I think it\\'s too costly to use twice a day, and if I used it in the daytime I would also need a sunscreen product. At night I usually shower, cleanse, tone and La Mer my skin. It feels so luxurious. The next morning my skin looks refreshed and glowing. Best of all, it feels and looks hydrated! The only drawback for me is the price, but I don\\'t believe I should give the product 4 stars based on that, because I do think the product is lovely. And because of it\\'s paste-like texture I have a hard time using less product (to try to spare it along) because I need so much to rub between my fingers to emulsify it. Overall I will continue to use La Mer, but will stick with once a day.\\n…read more'},\n",

I wear it on no makeup days or at night because it’s quite lubricating and doesn’t completely absorb. As someone with very dry skin, I appreciate this quality. To get the most out of this cream, make sure you warm it up between your fingers before you apply. It really does help it spread and absorb more easily. And if you’re lazy (like me) and don’t have time to stand around with moisturizer on your fingers for thirty seconds during your morning routine, just dot a bit on your face and continue on with your regimen while your body heat melts it a bit.

So I thought this would be a great way to fix it. Well... yes and no; it did but it didn't. Yes - this is a lovely moisturizer and my foundation (Tarte amazonian clay) goes on gorgeously after applying it. I used it under my eyes, too, and it made the flakiness and damage go away. So, yes. Yes, it worked. BUT: it also left me with milia (those little white bumps that are horrible to pop) all over under my eyes and even out into my crows feet and beyond. (I was using it 2x/day). Still, when I cut back to 1x/day I still had to be VERY careful around my eyes (and the milia are still there, dang it). Yes, my skin is softer. But ultimately, I don't get what all the hype is. Am I using it wrong? IDK: it's not carried at any Sephora near me so I have no one to ask (btw: stanks a lot for that, Sephora). I just can't justify this kind of money for what I got from this.

So far I have been using it for about 3 months and I have to say I am converted!! First off, my skin is very easily irritated only during season change especially from autumn to winter. I would usually get dry skin patches, flanky nose and outbreaks for no reason! I tried a lot of different moisturizers but at best I could only make this irritation to lesser extend but not completely gone. Until I started using the creme de la mer from beginning of October, nothing happened at all during the transition from autumn to cold winter!! I was very surprised and literally shocked!! I feel my skin very moisturized all day long even I used it only in the night time together with the treatment lotion. I find my skin more stable and have less and less outbreak. I have combination skin but with dry cheek and nose in colder months. My pores are also appeared smaller and my skin overall looks radiant and healthy, even without foundation! It doesn’t have any fancy function like whitening or anti-aging/firming, but this cream definitely makes your skin looks more supple! It didn’t give me any outbreak or worsen any if one or two popped up, in fact I think it might actually help with the healing and marks fading! I love this moisturizer!!\\n…read more'},\n",

I cleanse with micellar water or the Peter Thomas Roth anti-aging cleanser, then follow with Etude House toner and Drunk Elephant Framboos serum, then La Mer, and my skin looks incredible the next day, just lit from within, smooth, and with significant reduction in fine lines. I\\'m 32 and I\\'ve constantly been getting compliments on how I look 10 years younger with my current routine. During the day I use the DE C-Firma and B-Hydra and the Murad Essential-C Day Moisture with SPF. This combination has my skin looking the best it ever have. (See filter-free photo below.) I can\\'t justify the expense of the rest of the line, but if you use this consistently and in combination with other quality skincare products that work (for you), your skin will look great. Get a sample of the LM cream and try it. You might be shocked.\\n…read more'},\n",

After trying an endless assortment of skincare lines over the years, I have finally found my keeper! My skin is normal to a bit dry with some larger pores around my nose and cheeks. Also with aging comes the fine lines, dullness and a bit of sagging. I have noticed improvement in all my problem areas. Pores are smaller, skin looks more even and plumper, and lines are softened. I broke out with a couple of spots in the first couple of days but they rapidly cleared and I haven’t had any since. I also had a rough patch under my chin, sort of like chicken skin (if you have this you’ll know what I’m talking abou)...it’s gone! I hope the positive results continue and that I win the lottery because this stuff is expensive. However, you really do use only a small amount, too much and you’ll look greasy.
