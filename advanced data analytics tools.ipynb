The FedEx driver delivered it on a day where the weather was horrible. Not his fault of course. He double bagged my package in to giant plastic bags, tied the ends of the bags and he was not satisfied with just that since he didn't think that would keep it dry since the wind was also blowing very hard. He took my recycle bin that was outside and placed it over the bagged packages and then also grabbed a piece of a cinder block of concrete and placed it on top of the recycle bin. After that he wrote a note and placed the note inside my storm door telling me where my package was and why he did that. He wanted to make sure it didn't get wet, destroyed or stolen and I certainly appreciated the job he did and continues to do.\""

       "[\"I ordered a very important package that needed to be handled with care as it was very expensive almost 2 thousand dollars. The FedEx driver delivered it on a day where the weather was horrible. Not his fault of course. He double bagged my package in to giant plastic bags, tied the ends of the bags and he was not satisfied with just that since he didn't think that would keep it dry since the wind was also blowing very hard. He took my recycle bin that was outside and placed it over the bagged packages and then also grabbed a piece of a cinder block of concrete and placed it on top of the recycle bin. After that he wrote a note and placed the note inside my storm door telling me where my package was and why he did that. He wanted to make sure it didn't get wet, destroyed or stolen and I certainly appreciated the job he did and continues to do.\",\n",

I was ok with that. I was sure they would get it to me on Saturday, around 3:30 a FedEx truck went by my house, no package for me me. I contacted the service center and they were very helpful. I let the gentleman know I needed this part so I could fix my car so I could get to work on Monday. About 30 minutes later a kind gentleman called me from the Jacksonville sorting center, I was told all the drivers had finished that route, however he had a driver that had just finished his shift and would see if he could bring my package. The driver in his own personal vehicle brought the package to me. Outstanding service to go above and beyond to help me out. I hope this get back to the employees involved. I want to thank them for being outstanding people. To the driver thank you so very much for going out of your way help me out. This speaks highly of your professionalism. Thank you again.

My sender (Arun ** from ASPARTS) initially had a major delivery issue with DTDC Cochin branch. Poor guy, after much hassling with DTDC Cochin, he finally managed to secure and reroute the parcel via FedEx Cochin. Million thanks to my sender (Arun **), he’s very professional and responsible in handling the matter. He assured me that by hook or crook I will receive the painting and as assured I received it. Thanks Arun ** from ASPARTS!Also kudos to Singapore FedEx customer service officers (Mr. ** and Ms. **) and a special mention about Ms. **- she really calmed my anxiety considerably through her style of communication as I thought I had lost the parcel. Last but not least, thank you so much to all FedEx team (both Cochin and SG) for the rehandling service, relocating the missing parcel and redelivering promptly to my address.\\n                    Read full review']"

They are efficient, punctual, courteous and careful. I have tried other carriers but have always wound up with broken packages or on occasion missed delivery dates. Federal Express is also completely competitive when it comes to price. They’re right when they say, when it absolutely positively has to be there, you can count on them.',\n",

My last shipment and I do mean last the process was the same, inspect my gold to insure it and yes I was pissed and then I had to wait and watch to ensure my package was closed and resealed because the young lady just left my OPEN BOX laying on a table in back. My shipments with UPS cost a flat $20. If under a certain weight but Fedex charged me over $37. For the same size package I normally send. To add fuel to the fire I received TWO BILLS in the mail for that shipment on my Fedex account, one was for the shipment and the other was a charge for two boxes. When sending gold or silver anywhere it’s packaged in a padded box and then another padded box to prevent any possible damage. Here’s the real problems, first I paid in cash but my gold was ALREADY PACKAGED and resealed in my own boxes so why did I get billed twice and for boxes I didn’t even use??? It’s called incompetence. I’ll never again use Fedex and after I had cleared up the mess TWICE I closed my account. Bad company and terrible business.\\n                    Read full review',\n",

Like 'bad weather', which was ridiculous because during the days of excuses it had been in the 30's and 40's (great for MN) with no rain or snow or any kind of bad weather. If you run late at least do not think the customer is stupid and make up lies that are obviously false.\",\n",

My dog is in the house, so there is absolutely no danger, just lazy drivers who don't care.

       " 'I have VERY mixed feelings about FedEx. MOST of the time, they deliver small packages to me on time with no problems. But this week we were expecting delivery of 6 large cases of furniture and I had scheduled a vacation day just to take delivery of this shipment. But FedEx really disappointed me this time. FIRST, after I signed up for text updates, FedEx provided very vague information saying only that all 6 cases had been loaded on a truck and were \"out for delivery\", with no delivery time estimate; SECOND, around 1:30pm, the FedEx truck pulled up to our condo, stopped for a couple of minutes and then left, with no text update on the status, and no driver stopping by the front door to tell us what was going on ... they just left. So we continued to wait, calling their customer service number several times to find out what was going on, only to be told \"it\\'s out for delivery\" and \"we can\\'t say when beyond before end of day\". THIRD, we waited at home till 8:00pm (their delivery day ends at 8pm) and then called FedEx again (for about the 4th time) and they finally admitted that their data showed that the cases had never been loaded on the delivery truck that morning (which was why the driver didn\\'t/couldn\\'t deliver them when the truck was at our address). FOURTH, FedEx had no explanation for why the driver didn\\'t bother to tell us what had happened when they were at our unit or why no text update was sent, FIFTH they expressed no interest in the fact that their lack of proper updates caused us to wait at home for 7 hours after they knew the delivery would not happen as scheduled. Having taken a vacation day to take delivery on these cases, and I can hardly express the sense of wasted time, especially since I am now spending a 2nd day waiting at home for this shipment to arrive, again with no useful updates, just \"out for delivery\". For this shipment, I give FedEx a very frustrated 1 star, and for their normally good service on small shipments I upgrade that to two stars, but color me highly inconvenienced and exceptionally disappointed.\\n                    Read full review',\n",
       " 'FEDEX hub in Kernersville, NC does a horrible job of moving packages from their facility to the local district points. Three times in a row I track my package through Kernersville, NC to only see “bar code label unreadable and replaced”. This then allows this facility to deliver my package as late as they see fit. As I wait at home on promised delivery days only to see updates later in the day, often 5 and 6 days. Customer service does not help, email complaints are ignored, I even emailed the CEO!! Nothing, so my next step is to refuse to purchase items where FEDEX is the shipping method.',\n",

I request insurance on the item in case it gets missing or anything happens to it. The same day I call FedEx letting know that I don't approve the shipping and to retrieve it from the FedEx company. I also visit the place in which I have to send the article in the box. They got the alert and I was okay with the service. I had pay in total the amount of $95.37 in shipping and handling, so they didn't do anything about what I ask them to do. FedEx sends this special coin letting me with my money and coin hanging. I had called the company several times and they have people who can barely speak English. They just keep transferring my call from one department to another with no help. Today I received a letter stating that they are not liable for my loss of packages. I am in shock, this coin was a collection coin from my father RIP and I am in need of that cash and try to ship to a buyer in which later I had to change the destination of the coin, by alerting FedEx. FedEx makes their own decisions in getting their company off from this dispute. I went to the authorities to complain about the situation and they told me this is a civil matter situation.

Day 1: Delivery guys left a door tag because I was not around (simple reason: I work full-time) and I spoke to the company I moved my personal stuff to contact FedEx to drop the items at the apartment office which has the same address as my apartment and about 30 seconds walk from my apartment. Day 2: I came back shocked to see another door tag. FedEx refused to drop the item at the apartment office. I spoke to the company I used again and this time they got it written in several mails and confirmed with a reference number as confirmation. In addition, I had to sign at the back of the previous 2 door tags and pasted on my door for them to leave the items at the door if they refuse to leave the items at the apartment office thereby personally taking the risk of stealing and loss of the package.Day 3: FedEx refused to drop the item at the Apartment office again, rather I was shocked to see a third door tag, this time it was crossed at the back giving me no option to sign and they also took away the second door tag. Not the least, I was infuriated. After a heated phone conversation, I told them I was coming over to their facility at Henderson to pick my items using Uber, however, the manager collected my phone number and passed on to FedEx Ground and said they will call me and this was already some minutes past 7 pm (they close at 8 pm). From reading comments here, I did not need a seer or a prophet to tell me to just jump on the nearest available taxi to FedEx Ground facility. Just as I expected, the call never came. I went to the facility and picked up my items. My observation at the facility also confirmed serious and grave lapses in customer services. As somebody working in a service organization, I mean FedEx obviously has SERIOUS issues with customer service or perhaps I have been spoiled by Amazon superior and customer-eccentric service.I am not a seer, neither am I a prophet but a data-crunching guy. From what I read here, it appears this problem is serious and I do not know the extent to which this reflects the ethos and business culture of the organization. Failure in customer service like this gets trickled down like drops of rain and over time it gathers and becomes some clouds and over and over again, they form rain and... it takes failures in customer service to mildly affect year-end corporate results, but over time the compounding effect can threaten the life of an organization. As for me, NEVER in my life will I ever use FedEx for any reason except I don't have a choice to pick the courier company. Perhaps, Amazon may soon disrupt the logistics business model and we may not hear of FedEx again and the customer will be the ultimate winner in the end after all.\\n                    Read full review\",\n",

We were available and we are not a business and FedEx does not have a reputation for accuracy. So you know, I know the problem starts at the privacy gate to our house. FedEx will not allow their drivers to enter through a privacy gate, so how are they to know if I am home or not? FedEx lied. And besides, this is FedEx Ground and they do not need a signature. They have told me that they will not enter through the privacy gate, that they will leave all packages outside the privacy gate, and that they would not contact me for FedEx Ground. Why is 1/14 any different than what we have been told. FedEx, what are your policies and why are you having such an issue? Enlighten me with more than \"customer not available.\"So after the exception, I receive an email saying FedEx would re-deliver on 1/15. I check the status of the package throughout the day, but no updates and no delivery. At 2 PM, my wife takes her book and sits at the gate to wait for FedEx to deliver. Finally at 5:55 PM (yes, about 4 hours later) she comes back down the drive, we check the status, then call the customer agent at 5:58 PM. Upon getting an agent, she calls the \"station\" and reports that they would not deliver the package on 1/15. HOW LONG DID THEY KNOW? Can FedEx not update the delivery status??My dealings with FedEx leads me to the conclusion that FedEx is the worst delivery service. I paid $110 to have two, unassembled, plastic picnic tables delivered. One was damaged by FedEx and sent back, kudos to FedEx. The other package is in limbo. If FedEx did not want to do the work, then why are they agreeing to accept for delivery? Why do they not understand that all we want is a little transparency with our deliveries. Can FedEx tell me why they failed to deliver my package on 1/15? I will continue to update you on FedEx and their delivery promises.Original Review: Over the past three years, we have rarely had a delivery from FedEx without a problem. We have a privacy gate leading to our property and was told by FedEx that they would not deliver inside the gate, even when given the security code. We have been told that their drivers will leave packages outside the gate, but they will not call us when delivered. Last week, we received an email saying that our two packages would be delivered on 1/08, but that date was changed to 1/13. On 1/13, we watched the gate like a hawk, but no delivery. The next day on 1/14, we get an email saying there was a barcode problem and to expect delivery before end of day, Subsequently, we get another email that one of the packages was damaged and would be returned to the shipper. (Why not tell us this yesterday?)I call and ask about the package and was told that it was being returned and to call them. I asked about the second package and was told delivery of the second package had been \"attempted.\" Upon further questioning, I found out that driver saw the gate and left without leaving our package at the gate. The driver did not even leave a note saying he attempted delivery. I reiterated their policy about privacy gates, their promise to leave at the gate, and that they should call. I then instructed them to re-deliver and leave at the gate. We will see what happens tomorrow. FedEx is the worst delivery service.\\n                    Read full review',\n",

But he said he couldn't pick up the envelope, because he was from Fedex Ground and the label was for Fedex Express.I called Fedex and they said they'd have to schedule a new pick up and that could only be for Monday! And all the drop off locations I checked on their website don't pick up on Saturday and Sunday. Unbelievable! So they scheduled the wrong pickup, label was prepaid for overnight shipping since Thursday, and the document won't be received until Tuesday! Nobody was able to give me a solution for the problem Fedex created! That's why I won't be using this service any longer.

Initially, their customer service rep stated: \"that the quote is just an estimate and we reserve the right to adjust.\" After I explained the fact that it is both acceptable practice and a reasonable expectation that adjustments might and could occur, their quoting engine is required to at least be in the ballpark, versus 300+% off of the target to be a valid business practice. She escalated it up the chain, re-quoted based on the current rate table and ... Behold ~$79 popped up.Clearly the revenue department and the shipping departments are not on the same page, and FedEx should be ashamed for fostering a practice this incongruent with corporate responsibility.

       " 'This was my first time shipping internationally. I assumed that, as big of an organization as FedEx is and considering how long they have been in the business, they should really know what they\\'re doing. I went to my local FedEx Shipping Center to perform the shipment. The lady at the front desk was mostly nice but seemed to not be very consumer-friendly. I told her that this was my first time shipping internationally and was led to believe that she was telling me everything that I should know. She never notified me how detailed the description of the shipment is supposed to be and how it could severely negatively impact how easily it flows through customs if it is inaccurate to even a slight degree. She hardly told me anything about the international shipping process even when I asked about how different it might be from local shipping. She didn\\'t even seem to care to notify me of all of the ins and outs of international shipping. When it was costing me $180+ to ship roughly 5 lbs. of stuff, I should have already been second-guessing my decision and should have high-tailed it out of there. She didn\\'t even bother to show me the breakdown of the costs when I asked for it. Little did I know that this was only the beginning. As a note, I paid for the shipment on Dec 17th, 2019 and it was \"expected\" to be delivered to Spanish Town, Jamaica on the 30th, though the lady at the front told me when I was paying for it that the package would arrive on Christmas Eve (24th) if the entire shipping process went smoothly.When the shipment finally arrived at customs in the Kingston, Jamaica airport, I was notified via text that there was a clearance delay. The details on the tracking system simply said that detailed broker information was required. There was no specification what that might actually mean and I was never given a telephone number to call for questions. My significant other on the receiving end was contacted by FedEx and they simply told her that they needed a Letter of Authorization (LOA). They never specified what that entailed or how we could go about procuring such a letter. When we both went to the official FedEx website, there was an LOA but it was far too technical and was hardly helpful to either of us. Confused, I contacted FedEx customer support, specifically for International Services, to ask how we could go about filling out this letter. Of the five different people I talked to after calling five different times, not a single one of them knew anything about what an LOA even was, let alone how to fill one out. One of the customer service associates told me to call the number back that initially phoned the receiver, but when I told her that calling that number back was the first thing that I did and that it led me directly to the FedEx automated response service, she was completely dumbfounded and had no idea how to help me.Eventually she created a support case for me and said that someone would be in contact with either myself or the receiver for more information and that they could help us fill out the LOA. I knew that was just her trying her best to tell me that nothing would happen about it without being direct with me. Part of paying for FedEx International Shipping involves a \"broker selection\" service, which allows the shipper to either choose a broker to deal with customs or to let FedEx do all of the work. With FedEx being as incompetent as they were, we were left with no choice to act as our own broker. This is both highly confusing and potentially expensive for people who are totally new to international shipping and dealing with customs. Both of us are highly upset with FedEx. As I write this review, the issue has still not been resolved. Neither of us will be dealing with FedEx ever again. They have lost two loyal customers.

I contacted FedEx and was informed that my package was sure to be delivered by the end of the following day on 12/24/19. 6pm rolls around on the 24th and still no package so I call and talk to a lady named Lisa.

Now my package says it will not be delivered until the 26th of Dec. and the all of the food that my family sent for me to have a nice Christmas meal will be ruined because FedEx was incompetent and unable to do their job correctly.

       " 'Two weeks ago, I received 4 packages by FedEx of stereo equipment. One of the pieces was failing, so I contacted the company and got a waybill for FedEx to pick it up and send it back. Once it was picked up, the company sent me a replacement (Colorado to New Jersey). When the replacement arrived at my building the next week (a high rise doorman building), the driver looked at it and thought that it was the package he had picked up the week before, didn’t bring it into the apartment building, informing the doorman that he was as rejecting the shipment. I received a text that the shipment was rejected, and called the customer service number, and they said that it was an errant scan, and it should still arrive today. Later in the day, I ran into the doorman and found out the truth. I called the csr again (about 1:00 pm) and was told that they would call the station and they would contact the driver and have him get it to me at the end of his run. This didn’t happen, and in the evening, the status was changed online to “returning to sender”. I called customer service, they tried to call the station in Jersey City, and no one answered (twice). About 11 pm, I noticed that the status was changed to loaded for delivery, and it said it should get to me the end of the day (today, 12/24). In the morning, I got a text that the package had been rejected by the recipient (me!), and I hustled downstairs. The doorman was there, but there was no FedEx truck anywhere. I called customer service, they sent me to the tracer department and they started an inquiry, and said that it was out with the truck for delivery, but I noticed that the delivery address as now the sender’s address (with my name). I was told that they can’t change this, since the sender company has a delivery exception (they are on vacation for the holidays). I tracked down a FedEx truck in the neighborhood, but it wasn’t the one that covered my block. That driver gave me a number to call for their supervisor, as I had to go to work, so I called him, and he said he would look into it and call me back (he didn’t). When I got home from work at 5:30 pm, I called customer service, they put me in touch with the Jersey City Station, and the person there said that the package was already on a truck being shipped back to Colorado, and the only thing I could do was to file a dispute, and that I should have called the station. When I told her that I called the station with csr several times, was told that the csr contacted the station once, and that I had talked to a supervisor, and I hadn’t gotten an answer, all she said was that she wasn’t working on that shift. I filed the dispute, and they contacted someone else at the Jersey City station that said my package was on the truck there, waiting to be shipped back to Colorado. They tagged it, but without hearing from the sender, it would still ship out on Thursday sometime. Again, the sender is on vacation all week. I put out emails, voice mails, and forum messages to the sender to try to get them to respond, with no answer, but why should they have to ok shipment of a package to me that they shipped to me in the first place, when the only status change is that the driver rejected the shipment without any reference or consultation with me? This company is off the charts ridiculous when it comes to customer service. I now have a very expensive package being held in limbo at the station with the sender’s address on it, having to call daily to insure that it doesn’t get sent back to the sender, who is on vacation!\\n                    Read full review',\n",

       " \"I bought a dresser from Target for my mother about two weeks ago. The first time FEDEX attempted to drop off the package they left a tag since my mother was not home. At the third attempt I spoke to a FEDEX customer service rep and he told me that they would try to deliver the dresser again and he gave me the time frame of 4-7pm. My mother had to change her schedule to accommodate FEDEX and got home by 3:30pm. When my mother got home, she saw that the item was not there. She proceeded to go up to her apartment and around 4:30pm she checked again and there was a tag saying they missed her -- mind you she was already home. They never even rang the bell. Then frustrated I called FEDEX AGAIN. I explained to them that my mother was home and that she had no means of picking up the dresser at the warehouse (this is where they leave it after three attempts). I asked if they could drop it off on a day that she would be home and they said OK and that if she wasn't there they would leave it there. The day comes by No package. Then I had Target Customer care call them and they told Target that the package would be delivered MONDAY. Monday and Tuesday comes by and NO package. I proceeded to look at the tracking information on my order and it said that I needed to call FEDEX--so AGAIN I did. NOW another FEDEX customer service rep got on the phone and I explained to her THE WHOLE situation and THEN she proceeds to tell me that whoever I spoke to before lied to me and that FEDEX would NOT be delivering the item because it was already tried 3 times. Furious, I hung up the phone and decided to reorder the dress again with target to see if the delivery could be made again. I finally got a new tracking number for the second order I made and called FEDEX last night, asking to make a request that whoever delivers the dresser could LEAVE the dress even if my mother wasn't home Then she proceeds to tell me that FEDEX doesn't leave packages at apartment complexes...FEDEX. Please train your customer service people AND deliver people better. This is ridiculous and now I'm not sure if my mother will get her dresser. This is Christmas time and if you cannot be accommodating to your customers then what is your purpose? This is a horrible horrible way to treat people and your customers.

She said the only thing they could was hold the package at a Fedex. Funny how two Fedex employees gave me conflicting advice, and she even berated me for being confused. I told her the previous employee gave me contradictory advice to hers. So she gave me the address of the Fedex terminal where they would hold it for a pickup.I told the buyer where the address was. The buyer called the terminal up, and he was told specifically that they don\\'t allow people to make pickups there due to the high volume of people. So they are going to put the package on a delivery truck again tomorrow, and repeat this process. I paid Fedex to deliver my package, and they are not doing that. And they are not allowing me any other alternative except for their driver to keep refusing to deliver my package. Fedex is handling this situation terribly.

He said that Stansted haven’t come back to him about my missing property, so I just have to wait. He promised a callback, which they all do every call and never do. Disgusting service.

I was told that the shipper has to give permission. After getting the shipper to call them and give that permission, FedEx representative informed me that the package was back at their distribution center in Florence, which is another town over an hour drive from me, and that I can drive there to pick it up or wait till the following day to receive it! I left instructions for the driver to drop off the package early in the morning between 8 am-10 am. Today, Friday, nobody showed up, so I tracked the shipment by 11 am only to find a message that my package will be delivered on Monday instead!!! After calling FedEx customer service AGAIN and talking to a representative, she told me that my package never went out today because my business was “closed”!! I asked her where they ever got that from, if we clearly asked them yesterday to deliver the package early in the morning! Our website even clearly states our business hours and that we’re open on Friday. That was one of the lousiest excuses I’ve ever heard! I asked to speak to a supervisor and file a complaint. My call was transferred to a supervisor, whom I had to tell the whole story from the beginning. I explained to her that the excuse of “their business was closed” have been used falsely multiple times before and many of our packages were delivered on later dates than they were supposed to. She told me she will attempt to contact the local manager and get back to me. She called me back only to repeat the same lines, which make you feel like you’re talking to a robot, saying that the drivers are all out already and if I want I can always drive to that other town or wait till Monday to receive my package! When I asked her if she was a supervisor she didn’t confirm and told me that they are all “equal” at the customer service department! I filed the complaint and asked that someone follows up with me to let me know how that is going, and she replied that their policy forbids sharing the progress of internal complain handling with customers!I made sure to let her know that we will be taking our business elsewhere! We have paid thousands of dollars in business with FedEx, yet, their service was horrible, the deliveries weren’t on time, their customer service is awful and I would rather drive across the country and pick up my shipments than having to deal with them again.\\n                    Read full review',\n",

I was very pleased by this!Monday came and went and no phone. Tuesday morning I chatted with an online rep who wasn\\'t able to give me any information. At this point the tracking information had changed to \"No delivery data available at this time\". My husband called every day last week, and I chatted with online reps every day last week. Every person we spoke with was rude. Nobody could give us any information and the things that they did tell us, were all contradicting each other.As of this morning, the rep my husband spoke with told him, and I quote \"We opened an investigation and nothing was found. Claim was denied. There is nothing more we can do for you.\" And then disconnected my husband. ARE YOU ** KIDDING ME? This is the worst experience I have EVER had with customer service. I would NEVER recommend their shipping services to anybody that wishes to actually receive their items.\\n                    Read full review',\n",

Why bother sending an estimated time of delivery if, as the FedEx operator said, we have all day to deliver. I was also told that they don’t have contact with the driver and the facility closes at 1pm. (I was willing to go pick it up). Apparently FedEx are a part time company.

       " 'I was always impressed by Fedex’s success record and efficiency in delivering packages where they needed to go and on schedule. Clearly, it was a well-oiled precision machine. I have now seen a different side of Fedex—what happens when you throw in a monkey wrench. Quite simply, it can’t handle it. The service collapses and everything done by each and every player along the way is wrong. I also experienced a serious lack of integrity among the supervisory personnel when the matter was escalated. In summary, when Fedex is asked to do something outside its normal activity it turns into one of the worst-performing companies in the world.My nightmare—for so it became--with Fedex lasted from the morning of August 29th to the afternoon of August 30th. By the time it finished playing out, not only was the result failure, but I felt like I had been put through what amounted to torture. Everything which every Fedex representative did was wrong, and I encountered universal ineptitude. Please bear with me, because you cannot grasp the depth of the ordeal without a description of all the individually little things they put me through—in the process of failing to do what I was requesting.Here is the story. A package I sent to Virginia was due to be delivered in the early afternoon of August 29th. Without getting into details, it contained something that I valued highly. That same morning, however, I learned that the recipient had just left for a month’s travel (of course, she should have told me, but that is another story). Upon my calling, a Fedex representative informed me that the driver, working out of the Manassas, Virginia, station, had the box, but said he’s send a message to him to not deliver it, and it would probably reach him in time. I was pleased.When I called back at 2:00, a woman told me the box had been delivered at 12:30. But a message had been sent to him, I said! This message, the woman answered, had been sent via an indirect route that could take up to 24 hours to reach the driver. I complained loudly—there would be no one at that house for a month!-- and she was condescending. She offered me no good options. I called again at 4:00 and reached yet a third person. This person told me he would call the driver directly and ask him to go back to the house and pick up the package. This was interesting, because it was the first indication that a) the representative could reach the driver directly, which I’d been told was absolutely not possible and b) that the driver could be sent back the same day to retrieve it. So everything agents #1 and #2 thought they knew was wrong. And of course, speed was crucial to avoid the package being stolen. I even offered to pay extra for having the driver go back out that afternoon.At 6:00 I called back. As the package had not been picked up, I escalated the issue to the supervisory level, to a woman named Donna. She was so nice and so sympathetic. Everything the Fedex representatives had done was indeed wrong and she was so sorry! She would get on the phone at that moment and find the driver and tell him to drive out to the house to get the package back. This should take her about half an hour. She would call me back, and if I wanted to reach her all I had to do was call the main number and ask for Donna in the Customer Advocate team. And then she disappeared. She never called me back and she never answered my messages. In the multiple calls I made that night I learned that no driver ever went back that evening.There was no alternative to creating a new order for the package to be picked up the next day, presuming it had not already been stolen. As the driver was going to be dispatched out of the Manassas, Virginia, Fedex station, I called there at 8:00 on the next day, September 30. I gave Zack, the supervisor, all the background, and stressed the importance of the driver going there as early as possible.Zack was so sympathetic! He was disturbed about what had happened, and promised to send out the driver to pick up the package early. He was going to call me back as soon as he had something. Well, as was the case with Donna, Zack never called me back. I tried calling him but I never managed to find him again. I talked to another manager named who said the record was indicating that the driver had gone out at some point, but it was not clear if he’d gotten a package or not. The record eventually showed that the carrier had arrived only after 12:30. So much for my pleading that he go early and Zack’s assurances.When I called Manassas in the early afternoon, Fedex had yet one bit of torture for me. Using the tracking number I provided her, a young person informed me of what had happened, reading from the database. In a tone of authority, she said the carrier would have to return because the package had not been ready for delivery. “You mean the package was not there? That means it was stolen,“ I said. Absurdly, I had to satisfy her so that she’d transfer me to a supervisor. I had to waste time and energy going through the story and explaining that the carrier knew full well that the package’s absence meant it had been stolen. Why in God’s name were they saying the package was not ready for pickup????Eventually I understood. Fedex’s procedure is so rigid that the driver has to check off an explanation from a specific written list. “Stolen” is not included, so he checked off “not ready.” Interestingly, this designation triggers that he is going to return twice more to see if the package is “ready” because that is what the protocol calls for, although he, I and everyone else involved understand that Fedex’s delay allowed the package to be stolen before the driver’s first trip.That is where the situation stands now-- Fedex’s repeated ineptitude allowed my package, which contained things that were important to me, to be stolen. This is profoundly sad for me. Furthermore, the company turned the process itself into a painful personal ordeal; as long as this description has been, I’ve provided only the highlights of something that became sheer torture. Between the 29th and the 30th I talked to a good dozen representatives over many phone calls that easily consumed six or seven hours of that 24-hour period. And I still face more difficulty ahead-- the task of being reimbursed for its full value, which is sure to be protracted, deeply frustrating and probably unsuccessful.What I have found in Fedex is a huge systemic failure when responding to anything that deviates from normal procedure. Repeatedly Fedex representatives worked on the basis of an understanding of specific rules that turned out to be incorrect in crucial ways. The first representative could have contacted the driver in time to stop the delivery; the second representative could have offered to send the driver back that very afternoon. The contents of the box could have been saved from falling in the hands of thieves. Furthermore, the company is so rule-bound that, knowing the package was stolen, it puts down its absence to its “not being ready,” and then proceeds to carry out the protocol which this triggers. Dealing with the individual representatives is aggravating and time-consuming, because each person demands from you a complete explanation of the whole sequence of events. I remember with special vividness when I was already exhausted trying, as I described above, to convince a representative that the package’s absence was due to theft and not to the “package not being ready,” as the database said (and if the system says so, it must be true, right?).I am even more pained, however, by the shabby personal behavior. Supervisors Donna and Zack both talked such a good game. Both commiserated with me so sympathetically and both vowed to solve the problem. Donna was going to send the carrier right back out to get the package on the 29th and call me back, and Zack was going to send the carrier out early on the 30th and call me back. Neither did what they promised and both avoided having further contact with me. It is not just unprofessional, but there was a total lack of personal integrity. Is this what Fedex teaches them—to promise the customer whatever he wants, because in the end that customer is unable to find that supervisor again? This experience, in conclusion, has given me a peek behind the curtain. The well-oiled, precision machine is only one side of Fedex. I have glimpsed mediocrity, lack of proper training, poor judgment, and shabby personal behavior. I would say that Fedex has a lot to fix, but I have no reason to think it cares.\\n                    Read full review',\n",

I thought maybe this delivery required a signature and that’s why they hadn’t delivered it. I called customer service the following morning and the young lady from India assured me that no signature is required and that the package would be delivered that day. I checked the tracking info again and now it said my delivery would be made by end of day 8/24/19. Believe it or not, the delivery was again not made.

       " \"FedEx claims to have delivered a single package that weighs 117 lbs. with contents costing over $300 to my front door yesterday evening at 7PM. Time sensitive materials. We do not live close to anyone (if someone is a delivery person and doesn't check the address then that is a big problem in and of itself), the address was correct and there is no other house with this address. My husband and I were home by that door in our living room at that time. FedEx has delivered to us several times before without issue. We have 2 dogs that let us know when anyone is even in our driveway. There is no way someone could get to the front door without our dogs having been barking for quite some time. I found the delivered status 17 minutes later. I work from home and was there all day expecting this package. We checked everywhere. The road we live on is the only way in or out of our area and has very little traffic. You know when a delivery vehicle is on it. I own a small business and receive several packages from other companies each week. Beyond that, I have a large sign with a bench at the beginning of our sidewalk (you can't miss it, purposely in the way) asking that packages be put in, on or around the bench. For one person to bring a package that heavy to my front door involves superhuman strength going up a tall, narrow, steep staircase (the reason I have the bench and sign and partially have my front deck blocked). Updates state it made it to the Richmond facility and was put on the truck for delivery early that morning. If the delivery person left it at a different address, that would have been a huge obvious mistake and 117 lbs. is difficult to move so you'd better be right. Since I have yet to hear from FedEx with any sort of info or update after 4 calls/chat in 18 hours, it seems more likely that driver was involved in an offense where they should be investigated. Potentially stolen and not a lost scenario. Why would someone claim to have delivered it once it got that far into the system?I was told by the company I purchased the materials from that it's shipped with the brand and content listed on the outside. They knew what this was. It has not arrived here yet and, according to the first FedEx rep I spoke with, there is only 75 minutes left on the clock for them to call me back with information until I can escalate this elsewhere. Every FedEx person I've spoken with today has said I have to wait for the tracking team to call me to investigate. The second rep attempted to connect me with the team, but no one answered and I was told to await their call.

As I was standing next to my glass front door with my 110 pound dog sleeping in front of it I got a text alert that my delivery had been rescheduled for Monday because I was not home two minutes earlier which I most definitely was and I know for 100% fact that no one had been anywhere near my house because I would’ve seen them and the dog would’ve gone nuts. So I checked the security system and cameras and sure enough no one had been there. I immediately called FedEx & they said the driver couldn’t come back. Umm, he was never here! So I got a supervisor that assured me the package would be delivered by the end of the day. I waited 4 hours and called back to be sure and that representative confirmed that my package would be delivered. Now ten minutes before Ground stops delivering for the day, still no package, I call back and the representative tells me I will most definitely not see my package until Monday. I am furious, I needed this item for the weekend. Basically they blew smoke up my ** all day, they have GPS in the scan tools so they know darn well that driver wasn’t in front of my house when he scanned that package as me not being home. Who knows, maybe we would be better off with drones delivering packages!

Four calls later they called again to say the driver said I wasn't home. I was by my door the entire day and have a loud doorbell. So the driver lied or cannot read apartment numbers. Another two calls. On hold for 10 minutes. Only to say that the driver says I did not answer the door, LIES. I had to cancel a surgery followup appointment to wait for another day.The Return package had to be picked up that day because I was going into the hospital that Monday. This was a Thursday So I had to stay home on Friday too and wait. All I got from customer service was an admission that it was their error but I had to wait all day again and pay My Dr a 100 dollar cancellation fee.

Not only that, I could not find out who controls that specific drop box. This package was worth over $150 dollars and I can't even file a claim because, that's right--you guessed it!!

Julio, not wanting to wait, just takes what is ready at that time and does not wait for our orders to be fulfilled.

       " 'My first and only claim I ever made with FedEx and it was denied before I sent in the requested information…? According to FedEx when you ship a parcel with them it is covered with up to $100 of Insurance without having to purchase any additional insurance. This was told to me by the Rep at my Local FedEx Office. I recently sold a Denon AV Stereo Receiver, I had a similar Yamaha Stereo Box with the formed styrofoam inserts as well as additional foam blocks for added support topped off with the styrofoam popcorn fill.. This receiver was packed extremely well even by my standards. And finally secured at all seams of the box with packing tape. When the buyer received the receiver he immediately messaged me with photos showing a large dent on the right hand side of the receiver.. Because of this impact the electronic internals were now damaged as the stereo could not generate or reproduce sound.Now whoever at FedEx who was physically handling this box must have been playing soccer with it or seeing if it could fly off a building. Had to be something drastic to cause this type of damage as the package was truly re-enforced and packed so well. I had then proceeded to file a damage claim on FedEx’s website.. I gave the required information.. Showed photos of the receiver from before and after. 4 Pictures total and then submitted the claim being very optimistic that it would get approved as this was a fully Legit claim. I will mention I have in the past had 2 claims with the USPS for damaged packages and both were approved as the process was quick and fair and refund checks were issued swiftly. At this point I was just trying to recoup half of the total sale so I could honor a full refund to the buyer who was being very patient on his end. The claim said it would take 5 to 7 business days to render a decision.After a couple of days I got an email from FedEx requesting additional information?? Proof of value such as invoice stating the cost, photocopy of FedEx receipt, any other applicable documentation etc.. So I gathered all of the requested paperwork including 2 high res printout of the Damage/Dent. I could of faxed this info back or send it via Postal Mail.. I chose the paper mail route. I mailed this packet off to the “Cargo Claims Dept” on Monday 7/2/19. Later that evening I got a letter from FedEx DENYING my claim?? WTH…?? How could this happen as I just sent the packet 3 hours earlier in the day…? Of course there was no reason given for the denial. Just some LAME generic “Unfortunately we cannot approve your claim, yadda yadda.”I couldn’t believe it.. How can a company as big as FedEx making millions of $$’s deny a claim which completely shows their negligence?? It left my hands and went into FedEx’s possession on June 11th from CA till it got delivered in MD on June 15th so for 5 days this box was being brutalized. I’m certain the buyer who paid his hard earned money for a Denon Stereo wanted it to be a functioning one but FedEx made certain it wasn’t.Bottom line, is I am out $198. $145 for the stereo and whopping $53 freight charge. Not to mention the shady practices of FedEx which was completely shown here. The fact that my claim was Denied before they even received the packet with additional information in which they requested confirms their claims process is flawed. I believe FedEx deliberately denies most if not all of their claims as they probably dont get many people to challenge or give blowback. Well not only will I never use another service from FedEx ever again but I will be sharing my experience with FedEx on their social media sites as people need to know what this company is about and how they treat customers with valid claims.

The second time my package was supposed to be delivered between 5:00 and 8:00 p.m.; it was delivered at 3:56 p.m. and today the packages, and I paid for all 3 packages, were to be delivered between 5:00 and 8:00 p.m., they were delivered at 11:16 a.m. FedEx takes my money and then when they don\\'t honor their offer for which I have email and text confirmation, it takes them up to a week to reimburse me. FEDEX IS THE MOST DISHONEST COMPANY IN THE WORLD. As far as their Customer Service goes, if I have to hear one more \"We\\'re very sorry for your inconvenience.\" I will go postal! Apologies are not what I want. I want to be reimbursed for the Lyft rides to/from home that I had to take praying the whole time that the packages had not been stolen. I said that to the Customer Service person, that FEDEX should reimburse me and give me something for the aggravation they had caused; she replied that they don\\'t do that. Their Customer Service is worthless. Let me also add that last week when I was home to receive a delivery, there was a big sign on the door telling the FEDEX delivery person that I was home and which bell to ring, he brought the box up to the door and slammed it to ground all in the direct view of my neighbor. He rang the bell and ran back to his truck and drove off. By the time I got to the door he was gone. My neighbor told me what he had just witnessed and sure enough 15 of the cans were dented so bad they had to be thrown out and 2 cans had exploded upon impact. It was a mess. Is FEDEX going to reimburse me for the time and inconvenience of cleaning up the mess? I took pictures and Chewy.com reimbursed me for the unusable cans but that\\'s not the point. Also, the 3 boxes that cam 6 hours early today were supposed to be delivered on Saturday but a FEDEX Customer Service person who was obviously at a huge phone bank probably in India given his accent gave me the wrong instructions cancelling my Saturday delivery and there was no way to undo what he did. Someone told me that he probably did it on purpose because these phone bank employees hate having to listen to complaining Americans all day so they do things like this to make life as miserable for us as possible. I have already told Chewy.com that as long as they use FEDEX I cannot order from them again. That is not the mantra in my online shopping.

While I was working on a car, I witnessed that van pull up to a neighboring house. It sat there for about 20 minutes. Then it backed up to directly in front of where my vehicle was parked on the side of the road. I was working on someone else\\'s car at the time, just to clarify. It then sat there for another 15 minutes or so, and then pulled off. No one ever stepped outside the van. I could clearly see the driver through the windows, and I never saw him attempt to exit the van at any time.Two days, later, I receive an email saying that my package was delivered. To my belated excitement, I figured, \"Oh, their system might just be a little slow updating,\" so I checked my front door, and to my surprise, there was absolutely nothing on my porch. The tracking said it was left at the front door. So I called them. The customer service representative informed me that my package was indeed delivered. I in turn rebutted that it in fact had never been delivered at the time the tracking stated. I told them of the mystery van, of which I received no response. Told me an investigation is opened and that they would talk to the driver. On that very first, they told me that if my shipment had not still arrived within 48 hours, to contact the seller for a refund. That I would receive a call back shortly. On that call back, about 3 hours later, the only new information available was that Andrea would be personally handling my case.I felt a renewed sense of optimism that my desperately needed vacuum would be located and delivered. I was sorely mistaken. Called back the next day, and there was no new info to report. I asked if they talked to the driver, and never got a straight answer. I never talked to Andrea ever again. Told me I would receive a callback by 5:00 PM that day. The phone remained silent as my suspicions grew. So I called the next day, there was still no new info and not a straight answer about the driver, was told I\\'d be called back by 5:00 PM again. Again, the phone did not beep. I am still in dispute.

So, which means FedEx in USA is different from FedEx in all other part of the world.It is really pathetic that FedEx that one thing from the outside glare might be a good company was a very dirty and unregulated company with low standard. Their rep are not knowledgeable enough and all lack listening skill which is the most important skill in customer service.

       " \"Urgent package needed to be picked up at residence address on Friday and shipped overnight to client with a Monday delivery. Scheduled pickup early in the day on Friday, assured it would be picked up by 5:00 and driver would bring the shipping label. I called a few hours later to make sure the pick-up would happen, and gave my pickup confirmation number and was told the pickup had been canceled. (!!!!) I did not cancel it. I set the pick-up all over again, talking to an agent and making sure the pickup would happen. Since this was urgent, I was very nervous about whether it would be picked up on time. I spoke with the Dispatcher of the local pick-up area and he told me it would be picked up by 5:00 and driver would have the label with him. THE PICKUP DIDN'T HAPPEN.I found out at 530 that the pickup never happened and called FedEx and they told me they would pick up on Monday. Unacceptable since package had to be in NY on Monday (pickup was in California). I had to demand a supervisor since the customer service agent only apologized and said they would pick up on Monday. Finally, I get a supervisor who told me the package would be picked up on Saturday. I asked if the driver would bring the shipping label, since the package did not have a label. He put me on hold while he talked to the local dispatcher again, and came back and told me yes the driver had the label (I verified the information/destination of the label with him and he said they would bring it with them) and pick up the package on Saturday.I was relieved, thinking the package would actually make it on time after all. But, guess what happened on Saturday? The driver arrives to pick up the package, doesn't bring the label, knows nothing about the label, and doesn't take the package. I find out again too late to get the package picked up. I called at 3:30 local time and they said no one could pick up the package that late. Of course, I can't have any other service get out there that day either by that time. FEDEX completely blew it. Now I had to disappoint MY CUSTOMER because YOU didn't do your job.You have two jobs: Pick Up Packages and Deliver Packages. That is supposed to be what you do. I have no idea how you could have screwed this up over and over again on a simple pickup. I can't believe I have to disappoint my customer because you completely are incapable of doing the one thing you're supposed to do: Pick up a package. I spoke with FedEx again Saturday and asked if I should really trust them a third time to pick up this package. The answer is: No. Now I have to tell my customer it will be late but will be there Tuesday. I cannot expect that FedEx can come through and actually do it. I have scheduled UPS to come out and pick up the package.I cannot believe how bad this is. I cannot believe that you could mishandle an easy job so badly that it has impacted MY COMPANY PERFORMANCE with an important customer. I cannot believe that a company can be THIS BAD at what they are supposed to do millions of times a month: pick up and deliver packages. That's all you have to do. That's the one thing you proved incapable of doing for me. I spent about 5 hours on the phone with FedEx between Friday and Saturday to ensure this pickup happened. I did everything I could possibly do. You cost me a customer. You cost me a potential bad review that will haunt my business on social media for years to come.

We used FedEx to deliver our important boxes due to not having enough room in our vehicle. Once we made it to our new destination we were notified that all of our boxes except two had arrived. Days later the other two boxes “arrived” to the place that we had them delivered to. One of the boxes that we were anxiously waiting for contained all of my husband books for his medical residency. You can only imagine how expensive these books were. When we opened the box that was suppose to contain his medical books we were shocked. There was not one single medical book in the box, but instead it contained many other books that weren't ours (approximately 15). There was however two items that was ours in the box. I quickly called FedEx to let them know about this mix up, and the lady I spoke with said that she had no clue how this could of happened. She took my number and said that she would be contacting me after she made a few calls. A couple hour later we received a phone call from the same FedEx employee stating that our packaging may have been damaged, but they were still unsure as to why we were sent the wrong books. This box had all of our information on it, but the items in it did not belong to us. I filed a complaint with FedEx and their response was extremely rude and unprofessional. I was told that we wouldn’t be getting any money back from the books that were missing which cost thousands dollars. They said as far as they were concerned it is showing that we received all of the packages that we were suppose to. In other words the employee that I originally spoke with never made note of the huge mix up. Also, when I asked about the other person's belongings they stated “throw them away”. How could they be okay getting rid of someone else's items because they are trying to hide the fact that they lost our books and don’t want to own up to it. Here we are months later having to repurchase the books. With all of this being said I spoke with some of the most unprofessional/vile FedEx employees who not only showed no remorse, but also would not attempt to find the owner of the other books.

I physically watched the driver come to my residence and pull in front of my home. The driver never exited the vehicle and when I asked him if there was a deliver for my location he said \"No packages\". Less than 5 minutes later the package was marked undeliverable. I called FedEx immediately and made a complaint. They said the driver was coming back and at no time did the driver return. (Time and money wasted based on hourly because I called off ($173).On 5/29/19, I again had to call out of work to receive this package. Again I physically watched the driver pull into my street and then leave the location. Package again was marked undeliverable. Again money lost ($173). I called FedEx immediately and got not assistance because they said that the manager were sorting and would not be available to hear my concern. My wife has Stage 3 cancer which is why I have to call out when a package is coming. She physically can not get up out of the bed to even answer the door. This package was for a customer...

He said that he would TRY to see if they would re-attempt, but he couldn’t guarantee that. When I asked if he could let me know one way or the other (as in... CAN they come? Or not? Because the items will be ruined). He said that they don’t provide that service - I would just have to wait to see if they come back. When I called Sun Basket, the Rep tried to switch carriers but was told they are exclusively using FedEx. Her delivery supervisor told her that FedEx was having to contract out delivery services because they had over-booked PTO and were nearing the end of their fiscal year.

FedEx gave me an option to make an account so that I would be able to get updates to my phone so when my package would arrive. Well unannounced to me is that I have to wait 3-5 days for a confirmation code to be MAILED to my house so that I can complete my ONLINE account. Now when I check to see where my package is it says that according to FedEx package tracking my order no longer exists which is very concerning to anyone who checks where their packages are. As of this review, I have not had any updates with my package. Oh yeah don\\'t even get me started with FedEx absolutely useless virtual \"assistant\". Think at first I would be able to get a real person to help me. I was given the most basic robot response I could have gotten, of course the response to the question of where my package was is in fact responded to by a computer who just gave the worst answer possible to the question of why my package was not showing up on FedEx\\'s tracking. I am more upset above all else right now because I was fooled by FedEx to thinking my product would be safely shipped to my home and now it seems as if FedEx has lost something that I ordered that is quite expensive.

It was a Friday. I had it shipped and the attendant did not notice that overnight had a plethora of choices going along with it, including choosing if you wanted Saturday delivery. Apparently you can pay for overnight, but if you want that overnight to be on a Saturday, you pay even more. There was nothing online that told me that. It simply said 'Overnight delivery'. But they went and created several loopholes to burn you out of your money. Their customer service over the situation was a laughable joke. The woman that spoke to me, Beverly, spent the entire time telling me where I was wrong and that the attendant made a mistake.

No one greets me, despite the helpdesk being 5 feet away from the entrance; and if there’s a customer with a long order/task, I’m not informed of how long my wait may be, I’m simply ignored. There are two people at this store and I understand that a rush can be overwhelming, but both people don’t need to be working on one customer especially when the customers behind them have relatively quick tasks (ie dropping off a pre-process package, picking up business cards, picking up packages, etc). I ended up waiting 20 minutes to pick up a small package because the customer before me was arguing about the fact that the store ran out of bubble wrap and that there will be liability issues if the employees were to sell said customer bubble wrap from the back. When I was finally granted attention, the employee asked for my name. I responded with my first name only and they looked at me confused, and proceeded to say “(my first name) is that your whole name?”, granted it was a simple misunderstanding, BUT I LITERALLY POINTED MY ID TO THE EMPLOYEE WHEN THEY ASKED ME MY NAME, they could’ve looked or even borrowed my ID so they can go find my package.

There was a commotion behind our house that required us to step out of our home for fifteen minutes. Of course, that\\'s when FedEx tried to make their delivery. Calling FedEx, we arranged for them to deliver the time-sensitive package the following business day (today). We set up notifications on our phone so we would be certain to get the package that we absolutely need by end of business today.FedEx SMS-notified us that our package was ready to be picked up. We left work, drove to the business we\\'d chosen & FedEx agreed to deliver the package too... only to learn nothing was there. After waiting on hold more than 20 minutes to speak with a FedEx rep, we learned someone had \"coded\" our online delivery choice wrong and the package was being held for us at a FedEx regional office nearly TWO HOURS AWAY. And that the best FedEx can do is deliver the package to the correct business pick-up location MONDAY. So we\\'ve missed our deadline.

Already unhappy about that because I know their reputation in my area, but it was my only choice. I live downtown in a college town. We have private entrances at my complex as well as a traditional lobby entrance. At every private door, is a very obvious sign that tells delivery drivers to not leave packages on the front porches, and instead take them to the business center. FedEx is notorious for ignoring these signs. Sure enough, within two hours of my mlm package being delivered, it was stolen off of my porch. When I called FedEx, they told me to go around and ask my neighbors if they took my package. Beyond that, I should have gone on their website and taken (what the rep said was a lengthy process) the time to sign up for some package manager, to stop them from leaving packages on the porch. Absolutely no accountability for ignoring obvious signage, or using basic common sense. Luckily I had made my purchase through a great company and they replaced the item, but I still have to ship via FedEx. I have a friend who let me use his private address, but this is just ridiculous.

If I could leave 0 stars I would.So I shipped out a package from overseas to me, and because it was over a certain value it required a formal customs check. Okay. Well, they had a lot of clarification questions for me. Also okay. What wasn't okay was the way they handled it.I received notification that FedEx needed more information from me last Friday, 05/08. The package was -just- cleared less than an hour ago on Friday, 05/15. You may think that this sounds like a reasonable about of time for customs clearance, but here's the thing: it only happened -that fast- because I bugged them incessantly. And, reviewing the dozens of emails exchanged, it's obvious that all the clarification could have been solved with a ten-minute phone call.Instead, I had to reach out on my own to contact my agents both overseas and domestically, fill out required forms and give initial clarification information TWICE because communication between their branches is that bad (and they gave me an outdated form initially!), and cc a bunch of people on each correspondence that probably didn't even need to be cc'ed in order to even get a timely response (and even then I would only receive one email a day). It was like pulling teeth. If they had a good reason as to why they would only send ONE clarification question A DAY when there were more to go instead of all at once, I'd be more lenient on how long it took, but at no point in the process did they bother to explain to me why questions were being asked, why they were being asked when they were, or even how long I had to answer all these questions before my package was returned to sender!And yes, before you ask, I also tried calling. A lot. But I didn't have a phone number to contact my domestic agent and every time I called customer service they'd either 1) have outdated information on the customs status or 2) say they couldn't do anything to help me. The one phone number I did have from my original notification of the customs hold was for someone with the same hours as my agent so I couldn't expedite the process that way (although I did loop her in at some point to try and speed up the email back-and-forth).There was an instance of an item that I had to provide the manufacturer's name and address for, but I didn't have this information as the item was purchased secondhand. Not only was I asked to provide the information multiple times -after I said I didn't have it-, but I also went out on a limb and brainstormed several ideas for them to get it passed customs (emphasize it was a decorative item not for use, provide address of store where it was bought, even say it could be discarded as it was like a $3 item) and I was NEVER INFORMED what the final status of this item ended up being. Was it thrown out? Is it still in the package? Who knows, because my email asking these questions was, of course, ignored, and my package was approved a few hours later.I could go on and on, of course, but if you can't understand my frustration with this company by this point I don't know what else I can say to convince you. For all I know, they could be great with packages that don't require a customs inquiry--but when they do, they are an absolute stressful nightmare. Terrible, terrible experience.\",\n",

My package should have been placed on another truck if this driver isn't willing to make my delivery. It's gotten out of hand.

Then I say forget it these people are just\\xa0incompetent I will go pick up the package up and I schudule it with the \"SUPERVISOR\" and I go pick it up and the cannot locate my package! How the hell!? Not only do I waste my time waiting an hour for someone to BS me around and lie the whole time but I also waste my time going to Fedex because these people can\\'t even locate my damn package!

You can’t just call your local facility. Why?Why all of the hurdles? They take you through their annoying and glitchy automated service where if you’re lucky you may get someone who you can actually understand. And if you’re luckier they’ll be able to actually help you. But I called about 15 times today and about 1 person was actually helpful. All of this hassle because FedEx fails to inform you that someone needs to be there to receive the package. They can’t just leave it at the door like literally everyone else does. Had I known that important piece of information, I could have arranged for someone to be there but they didn’t bother to tell me.Bottom line. Choose UPS.',\n",

I called they said it’ll be there tomorrow for sure. Waited all day for it to once again not be delivered instead it was at a local warehouse. Two other items I’ve recently purchased one was supposed to be delivered on the day it said then receive a notification that the date was pushed back. Now today the other items that were supposed to arrive tomorrow May 16th have now been changed to Monday May 18th but those items according to the tracking have been sitting in a fedex warehouse for over a week now.

My 15-year-old son was in the house and nobody rang the doorbell. I called customer service they said that they would Contact the driver and that he would turn around and deliver my package. An hour and a half later he still hadn’t showed up I called FedEx again and they apologized and said that they would deliver between 5 and 8 PM. I waited again from 5 to 8 and still nobody showed up. Next day in the morning I called fedex and let them know that I will be gone until 3 PM. A fedex employee said she scheduled the delivery from 3 to 7, I said perfect.

So I called Shari’s Berries and they were nice enough to refund my money AND ship out another box of strawberries to my mom.  The new box was shipped out on Wed 5/13 With scheduled delivery Thurs. 5/14.  I went to track the package yesterday morning and the pkg showed delivering by 4:30 pm.  So around 1:00 I tracked it again and the delivery got changed to Fri. 5/15 by 4:30, so I called to verify this info with fedex & told them to not bother delivering since the package was going to be ruined again.    About 2:45 I got an email that the pkg was delivered, which I found odd because I had spoken with fedex.  I called my mom and she was laughing and said that the package that was delivered was the original package from Mother’s Day weekend and it SMELLED SO BAD AND WAS DRIPPING OUT OF THE BOX.
